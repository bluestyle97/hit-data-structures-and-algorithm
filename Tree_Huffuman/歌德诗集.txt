모모The Poems of Goethe

모모Translated in the original metresby Edgar Alfred Bowring

모모THE TRANSLATOR'S ORIGINAL DEDICATION.

모모TO THE COUNTESS GRANVILLE.

모모MY DEAR LADY GRANVILLE,--

모모THE reluctance which must naturally be felt by any one inventuring to give to the world a book such as the present, wherethe beauties of the great original must inevitably be diminished,if not destroyed, in the process of passing through thetranslator's hands, cannot but be felt in all its force when thattranslator has not penetrated beyond the outer courts of thepoetic fane, and can have no hope of advancing further, or ofreaching its sanctuary. But it is to me a subject of peculiarsatisfaction that your kind permission to have your nameinscribed upon this page serves to attain a twofold end--onedirect and personal, and relating to the present day; the otherreflected and historical, and belonging to times long gone by. Ofthe first little need now be said, for the privilege is whollymine, in making this dedication: as to the second, one word ofexplanation will suffice for those who have made the greatestpoet of Germany, almost of the world, their study, and to whomthe story of his life is not unknown. All who have followed thecareer of GOETHE are familiar with the name and character ofDALBERG, and also with the deep and lasting friendship thatexisted between them, from which SCHILLER too was not absent;recalling to the mind the days of old, when a Virgil and a Horaceand a Maecenas sat side by side.

모모Remembering, then, the connection that, in a former century,was formed and riveted between your illustrious ancestor and himwhom it is the object of these pages to represent, I deem it ahappy augury that the link then established finds itself notwholly severed even now (although its strength may beimmeasurably weakened in the comparison), inasmuch as this pagebrings them once more in contact, the one in the person of hisown descendant, the other in that of the translator of his Poems.

모모Believe me, with great truth,Very faithfully yours,EDGAR A. BOWRING.London, April, 1853.

모모ORIGINAL PREFACE.

모모I feel no small reluctance in venturing to give to the public awork of the character of that indicated by the title-page to thepresent volume; for, difficult as it must always be to rendersatisfactorily into one's own tongue the writings of the bards ofother lands, the responsibility assumed by the translator isimmeasurably increased when he attempts to transfer the thoughtsof those great men, who have lived for all the world and for allages, from the language in which they were originally clothed, toone to which they may as yet have been strangers. Preeminentlyis this the case with Goethe, the most masterly of all the masterminds of modern times, whose name is already inscribed on thetablets of immortality, and whose fame already extends over theearth, although as yet only in its infancy. Scarcely have twodecades passed away since he ceased to dwell among men, yet henow stands before us, not as a mere individual, like those whomthe world is wont to call great, but as a type, as an emblem--therecognised emblem and representative of the human mind in itspresent stage of culture and advancement.

모모Among the infinitely varied effusions of Goethe's pen, perhapsthere are none which are of as general interest as his Poems,which breathe the very spirit of Nature, and embody the realmusic of the feelings. In Germany, they are universally known,and are considered as the most delightful of his works. Yet inthis country, this kindred country, sprung from the same stem,and so strongly resembling her sister in so many points, they arenearly unknown. Almost the only poetical work of the greatestPoet that the world has seen for ages, that is really andgenerally read in England, is Faust, the translations of whichare almost endless; while no single person has as yet appeared toattempt to give, in an English dress, in any collective orsystematic manner, those smaller productions of the genius ofGoethe which it is the object of the present volume to lay beforethe reader, whose indulgence is requested for its manyimperfections. In addition to the beauty of the language in whichthe Poet has given utterance to his thoughts, there is a depth ofmeaning in those thoughts which is not easily discoverable atfirst sight, and the translator incurs great risk of overlookingit, and of giving a prosaic effect to that which in the originalcontains the very essence of poetry. It is probably thisdifficulty that has deterred others from undertaking the task Ihave set myself, and in which I do not pretend to do more thanattempt to give an idea of the minstrelsy of one so unrivalled,by as truthful an interpretation of it as lies in my power.

모모The principles which have guided me on the present occasion arethe same as those followed in the translation of Schiller'scomplete Poems that was published by me in 1851, namely, asliteral a rendering of the original as is consistent with goodEnglish, and also a very strict adherence to the metre of theoriginal. Although translators usually allow themselves greatlicense in both these points, it appears to me that by so doingthey of necessity destroy the very soul of the work they professto translate. In fact, it is not a translation, but a paraphrasethat they give. It may perhaps be thought that the presenttranslations go almost to the other extreme, and that a renderingof metre, line for line, and word for word, makes it impossibleto preserve the poetry of the original both in substance and insound. But experience has convinced me that it is not so, andthat great fidelity is even the most essential element ofsuccess, whether in translating poetry or prose. It was thereforevery satisfactory to me to find that the principle laid down byme to myself in translating Schiller met with the very general,if not universal, approval of the reader. At the same time, Ihave endeavoured to profit in the case of this, the younger bornof the two attempts made by me to transplant the muse of Germanyto the shores of Britain, by the criticisms, whether friendly orhostile, that have been evoked or provoked by the appearance ofits elder brother.

모모As already mentioned, the latter contained the whole of thePoems of Schiller. It is impossible, in anything like the samecompass, to give all the writings of Goethe comprised under thegeneral title of Gedichte, or poems. They contain between 30,000and 40,000 verses, exclusive of his plays. and similar works.Very many of these would be absolutely without interest to theEnglish reader,--such as those having only a local application,those addressed to individuals, and so on. Others again, fromtheir extreme length, could only be published in separatevolumes. But the impossibility of giving all need form noobstacle to giving as much as possible; and it so happens thatthe real interest of Goethe's Poems centres in those classes ofthem which are not too diffuse to run any risk when translated ofoffending the reader by their too great number. Those by far themore generally admired are the Songs and Ballads, which are about150 in number, and the whole of which are contained in thisvolume (with the exception of one or two of the former, whichhave been, on consideration, left out by me owing to theirtrifling and uninteresting nature). The same may be said of theOdes, Sonnets, Miscellaneous Poems, &c.

모모In addition to those portions of Goethe's poetical works whichare given in this complete form, specimens of the different otherclasses of them, such as the Epigrams, Elegies, &c., are added,as well as a collection of the various Songs found in his Plays,making a total number of about 400 Poems, embraced in the presentvolume.

모모A sketch of the life of Goethe is prefixed, in order that thereader may have before him both the Poet himself and the Poet'soffspring, and that he may see that the two are but one--thatGoethe lives in his works, that his works lived in him.

모모The dates of the different Poems are appended throughout, thatof the first publication being given, when that of thecomposition is unknown. The order of arrangement adopted is thatof the authorized German editions. As Goethe would never arrangethem himself in the chronological order of their composition, ithas become impossible to do so, now that he is dead. The planadopted in the present volume would therefore seem to be thebest, as it facilitates reference to the original. Thecircumstances attending or giving rise to the production of anyof the Poems will be found specified in those cases in which theyhave been ascertained by me.

모모Having said thus much by way of explanation, I now leave thebook to speak for itself, and to testify to its own character.Whether viewed with a charitable eye by the kindly reader, whowill make due allowance for the difficulties attending itsexecution, or received by the critic, who will judge of it onlyby its own merits, with the unfriendly welcome which it veryprobably deserves, I trust that I shall at least be pardoned formaking an attempt, a failure in which does not necessarily implydisgrace, and which, by leading the way, may perhaps become themeans of inducing some abler and more worthy (but not moreearnest) labourer to enter upon the same field, the riches ofwhich will remain unaltered and undiminished in value, evenalthough they may be for the moment tarnished by the hands of theless skilful workman who first endeavours to transplant them to aforeign soil.

모모PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

모모I have taken advantage of the publication of a Second Editionof my translation of the Poems of Goethe (originally published in1853), to add to the Collection a version of the much admiredclassical Poem of Hermann and Dorothea, which was previouslyomitted by me in consequence of its length. Its universalpopularity, however, and the fact that it exhibits theversatility of Goethe's talents to a greater extent than,perhaps, any other of his poetical works, seem to call for itsadmission into the present volume.

모모On the other hand I have not thought it necessary to includethe sketch of Goethe's Life that accompanied the First Edition.At the time of its publication, comparatively little was known inthis country of the incidents of his career, and my sketch wasavowedly written as a temporary stop-gap, as it were, pending theproduction of some work really deserving the tittle of a life ofGoethe. Not to mention other contributions to the literature ofthe subject, Mr. Lewis's important volumes give the Englishreader all the information he is likely to require respectingGoethe's career, and my short memoir appeared to be no longerrequired.

모모I need scarcely add that I have availed myself of thisopportunity to make whatever improvements have suggestedthemselves to me in my original version of these Poems.

모모THE POEMS OF GOETHE.

모모DEDICATION.

모모The morn arrived; his footstep quickly scared

모모The gentle sleep that round my senses clung,And I, awak'ning, from my cottage fared,

모모And up the mountain side with light heart sprung;At every step I felt my gaze ensnared

모모By new-born flow'rs that full of dew-drops hung;The youthful day awoke with ecstacy,And all things quicken'd were, to quicken me.

모모And as I mounted, from the valley rose

모모A streaky mist, that upward slowly spread,Then bent, as though my form it would enclose,

모모Then, as on pinions, soar'd above my head:My gaze could now on no fair view repose,

모모in mournful veil conceal'd, the world seem'd dead;The clouds soon closed around me, as a tomb,And I was left alone in twilight gloom.

모모At once the sun his lustre seem'd to pour,

모모And through the mist was seen a radiant light;Here sank it gently to the ground once more,

모모There parted it, and climb'd o'er wood and height.How did I yearn to greet him as of yore,

모모After the darkness waxing doubly bright!The airy conflict ofttimes was renew'd,Then blinded by a dazzling glow I stood.

모모Ere long an inward impulse prompted me

모모A hasty glance with boldness round to throw;At first mine eyes had scarcely strength to see,

모모For all around appear'd to burn and glow.Then saw I, on the clouds borne gracefully,

모모A godlike woman hov'ring to and fro.In life I ne'er had seen a form so fair--She gazed at me, and still she hover'd there.

모모"Dost thou not know me?" were the words she said

모모In tones where love and faith were sweetly bound;"Knowest thou not Her who oftentimes hath shed

모모The purest balsam in each earthly wound?Thou knows't me well; thy panting heart I led

모모To join me in a bond with rapture crown'd.Did I not see thee, when a stripling, yearningTo welcome me with tears, heartfelt and burning?"

모모"Yes!" I exclaim'd, whilst, overcome with joy,

모모I sank to earth; "I long have worshipp'd thee;Thou gav'st me rest, when passions rack'd the boy,

모모Pervading ev'ry limb unceasingly;Thy heav'nly pinions thou didst then employ

모모The scorching sunbeams to ward off from me.From thee alone Earth's fairest gifts I gain'd,Through thee alone, true bliss can be obtain'd.

모모"Thy name I know not; yet I hear thee nam'd

모모By many a one who boasts thee as his own;Each eye believes that tow'rd thy form 'tis aim'd,

모모Yet to most eyes thy rays are anguish-sown.Ah! whilst I err'd, full many a friend I claim'd,

모모Now that I know thee, I am left alone;With but myself can I my rapture share,I needs must veil and hide thy radiance fair.

모모She smiled, and answering said: "Thou see'st how wise,

모모How prudent 'twas but little to unveil!Scarce from the clumsiest cheat are clear'd thine eyes,

모모Scarce hast thou strength thy childish bars to scale,When thou dost rank thee 'mongst the deities,

모모And so man's duties to perform would'st fail!How dost thou differ from all other men?Live with the world in peace, and know thee then!"

모모"Oh, pardon me," I cried, "I meant it well:

모모Not vainly did'st thou bless mine eyes with light;For in my blood glad aspirations swell,

모모The value of thy gifts I know aright!Those treasures in my breast for others dwell,

모모The buried pound no more I'll hide from sight.Why did I seek the road so anxiously,If hidden from my brethren 'twere to be?"

모모And as I answer'd, tow'rd me turn'd her face,

모모With kindly sympathy, that god-like one;Within her eye full plainly could I trace

모모What I had fail'd in, and what rightly done.She smiled, and cured me with that smile's sweet grace,

모모To new-born joys my spirit soar'd anon;With inward confidence I now could dareTo draw yet closer, and observe her there.

모모Through the light cloud she then stretch'd forth her hand,

모모As if to bid the streaky vapour fly:At once it seemed to yield to her command,

모모Contracted, and no mist then met mine eye.My glance once more survey'd the smiling land,

모모Unclouded and serene appear'd the sky.Nought but a veil of purest white she held,And round her in a thousand folds it swell'd.

모모"I know thee, and I know thy wav'ring will.

모모I know the good that lives and glows in thee!"--Thus spake she, and methinks I hear her still--

모모"The prize long destined, now receive from me;That blest one will be safe from ev'ry ill,

모모Who takes this gift with soul of purity,--"The veil of Minstrelsy from Truth's own hand,Of sunlight and of morn's sweet fragrance plann'd.

모모"And when thou and thy friends at fierce noon-day

모모Are parched with heat, straight cast it in the air!Then Zephyr's cooling breath will round you play,

모모Distilling balm and flowers' sweet incense there;The tones of earthly woe will die away,

모모The grave become a bed of clouds so fair,To sing to rest life's billows will be seen,The day be lovely, and the night serene."--

모모Come, then, my friends! and whensoe'er ye find

모모Upon your way increase life's heavy load;If by fresh-waken'd blessings flowers are twin'd

모모Around your path, and golden fruits bestow'd,We'll seek the coming day with joyous mind!

모모Thus blest, we'll live, thus wander on our roadAnd when our grandsons sorrow o'er our tomb,Our love, to glad their bosoms, still shall bloom.

모모SONGS.-----Late resounds the early strain;Weal and woe in song remain.-----SOUND, SWEET SONG.

모모SOUND, sweet song, from some far land,Sighing softly close at hand,

모모Now of joy, and now of woe!

모모Stars are wont to glimmer so.

모모Sooner thus will good unfold;Children young and children oldGladly hear thy numbers flow.

모모* In the cases in which the date is marked thus (*), itsignifies the original date of publication--the year ofcomposition not being known. In other cases, the date given isthat of the actual composition. All the poems are arranged in theorder of the recognised German editions.-----TO THE KIND READER.

모모No one talks more than a Poet;Fain he'd have the people know it.

모모Praise or blame he ever loves;None in prose confess an error,Yet we do so, void of terror,

모모In the Muses' silent groves.

모모What I err'd in, what corrected,What I suffer'd, what effected,

모모To this wreath as flow'rs belong;For the aged, and the youthful,And the vicious, and the truthful,

모모All are fair when viewed in song.

모모1800.*-----THE NEW AMADIS.

모모IN my boyhood's days so drear

모모I was kept confined;There I sat for many a year,

모모All alone I pined,As within the womb.

모모Yet thou drov'st away my gloom,

모모Golden phantasy!I became a hero true,

모모Like the Prince Pipi,And the world roam'd through,

모모Many a crystal palace built,

모모Crush'd them with like art,And the Dragon's life-blood spilt

모모With my glitt'ring dart.Yes! I was a man!

모모Next I formed the knightly plan

모모Princess Fish to free;She was much too complaisant,

모모Kindly welcomed me,--And I was gallant.

모모Heav'nly bread her kisses proved,

모모Glowing as the wine;Almost unto death I loved.

모모Sun-s appeared to shineIn her dazzling charms.

모모Who hath torn her from mine arms?

모모Could no magic bandMake her in her flight delay?

모모Say, where now her land?Where, alas, the way?

모모1775.*-----WHEN THE FOX DIES, HIS SKIN COUNTS.*

모모(* The name of a game, known in English as "Jack's alight.")

모모WE young people in the shade

모모Sat one sultry day;Cupid came, and "Dies the Fox"

모모With us sought to play.

모모Each one of my friends then sat

모모By his mistress dear;Cupid, blowing out the torch,

모모Said: "The taper's here!"

모모Then we quickly sent around

모모The expiring brand;Each one put it hastily

모모ln his neighbour's hand.

모모Dorilis then gave it me,

모모With a scoffing jest;Sudden into flame it broke,

모모By my fingers press'd.

모모And it singed my eyes and face,

모모Set my breast on fire;Then above my head the blaze

모모Mounted ever higher.

모모Vain I sought to put it out;

모모Ever burned the flame;Stead of dying, soon the Fox

모모Livelier still became.

모모1770.-----THE HEATHROSE.

모모ONCE a boy a Rosebud spied,

모모Heathrose fair and tender,All array'd in youthful pride,--Quickly to the spot he hied,

모모Ravished by her splendour.Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

모모Heathrose fair and tender!

모모Said the boy, "I'll now pick thee,

모모Heathrose fair and tender!"Said the rosebud, "I'll prick thee,So that thou'lt remember me,

모모Ne'er will I surrender!"Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

모모Heathrose fair and tender!

모모Now the cruel boy must pick

모모Heathrose fair and tender;Rosebud did her best to prick,--Vain 'twas 'gainst her fate to kick--

모모She must needs surrender.Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

모모Heathrose fair and tender!

모모1779.*-----BLINDMAN'S BUFF.

모모OH, my Theresa dear!Thine eyes, I greatly fear,

모모Can through the bandage see!Although thine eyes are bound,By thee I'm quickly found,

모모And wherefore shouldst thou catch but me?

모모Ere long thou held'st me fast,With arms around me cast,

모모Upon thy breast I fell;Scarce was thy bandage gone,When all my joy was flown,

모모Thou coldly didst the blind repel.

모모He groped on ev'ry side,His limbs he sorely tried,

모모While scoffs arose all round;If thou no love wilt give,In sadness I shall live,

모모As if mine eyes remain'd still bound.

모모1770.-----CHRISTEL.

모모My senses ofttimes are oppress'd,

모모Oft stagnant is my blood;But when by Christel's sight I'm blest,

모모I feel my strength renew'd.I see her here, I see her there,

모모And really cannot tellThe manner how, the when, the where,

모모The why I love her well.

모모If with the merest glance I view

모모Her black and roguish eyes,And gaze on her black eyebrows too,

모모My spirit upward flies.Has any one a mouth so sweet,

모모Such love-round cheeks as she?Ah, when the eye her beauties meet,

모모It ne'er content can be.

모모And when in airy German dance

모모I clasp her form divine,So quick we whirl, so quick advance,

모모What rapture then like mine!And when she's giddy, and feels warm,

모모I cradle her, poor thing,Upon my breast, and in mine arm,--

모모I'm then a very king!

모모And when she looks with love on me,

모모Forgetting all but this,When press'd against my bosom, she

모모Exchanges kiss for kiss,All through my marrow runs a thrill,

모모Runs e'en my foot along!I feel so well, I feel so ill,

모모I feel so weak, so strong!

모모Would that such moments ne'er would end!

모모The day ne'er long I find;Could I the night too with her spend,

모모E'en that I should not mind.If she were in mine arms but held,

모모To quench love's thirst I'd try;And could my torments not be quell'd,

모모Upon her breast would die.

모모1776.*------THE COY ONE.

모모ONE Spring-morning bright and fair,

모모Roam'd a shepherdess and sang;Young and beauteous, free from care,

모모Through the fields her clear notes rang:So, Ia, Ia! le ralla, &c.

모모Of his lambs some two or three

모모Thyrsis offer'd for a kiss;First she eyed him roguishly,

모모Then for answer sang but this:So, Ia, Ia! le ralla, &c.

모모Ribbons did the next one offer,

모모And the third, his heart so trueBut, as with the lambs, the scoffer

모모Laugh'd at heart and ribbons too,--Still 'twas Ia! le ralla, &c.

모모1791.-----THE CONVERT.

모모As at sunset I was straying

모모Silently the wood along,Damon on his flute was playing,

모모And the rocks gave back the song,So la, Ia! &c.

모모Softly tow'rds him then he drew me;

모모Sweet each kiss he gave me then!And I said, "Play once more to me!"

모모And he kindly play'd again,So la, la! &c.

모모All my peace for aye has fleeted,

모모All my happiness has flown;Yet my ears are ever greeted

모모With that olden, blissful tone,So la, la! &c.

모모1791.-----PRESERVATION.

모모My maiden she proved false to me;

모모To hate all joys I soon began,

모모Then to a flowing stream I ran,--The stream ran past me hastily.

모모There stood I fix'd, in mute despair;

모모My head swam round as in a dream;

모모I well-nigh fell into the stream,And earth seem'd with me whirling there.

모모Sudden I heard a voice that cried--

모모I had just turn'd my face from thence--

모모It was a voice to charm each sense:"Beware, for deep is yonder tide!"

모모A thrill my blood pervaded now,

모모I look'd and saw a beauteous maid

모모I asked her name--twas Kate, she said--"Oh lovely Kate! how kind art thou!

모모"From death I have been sav'd by thee,

모모'Tis through thee only that I live;

모모Little 'twere life alone to give,My joy in life then deign to be!"

모모And then I told my sorrows o'er,

모모Her eyes to earth she sweetly threw;

모모I kiss'd her, and she kiss'd me too,And--then I talked of death no more.

모모1775.*-----THE MUSES' SON.

모모[Goethe quotes the beginning of this song in his Autobiography,as expressing the manner in which his poetical effusions used topour out from him.]

모모THROUGH field and wood to stray,And pipe my tuneful lay,--

모모'Tis thus my days are pass'd;And all keep tune with me,And move in harmony,

모모And so on, to the last.

모모To wait I scarce have powerThe garden's earliest flower,

모모The tree's first bloom in Spring;They hail my joyous strain,--When Winter comes again,

모모Of that sweet dream I sing.

모모My song sounds far and near,O'er ice it echoes clear,

모모Then Winter blossoms bright;And when his blossoms fly,Fresh raptures meet mine eye,

모모Upon the well-till'd height.

모모When 'neath the linden tree,Young folks I chance to see,

모모I set them moving soon;His nose the dull lad curls,The formal maiden whirls,

모모Obedient to my tune.

모모Wings to the feet ye lend,O'er hill and vale ye send

모모The lover far from home;When shall I, on your breast,.

모모Ye kindly muses, rest,And cease at length to roam?

모모1800.*------FOUND.

모모ONCE through the forest

모모Alone I went;To seek for nothing

모모My thoughts were bent.

모모I saw i' the shadow

모모A flower stand thereAs stars it glisten'd,

모모As eyes 'twas fair.

모모I sought to pluck it,--

모모It gently said:"Shall I be gather'd

모모Only to fade?"

모모With all its roots

모모I dug it with care,And took it home

모모To my garden fair.

모모In silent corner

모모Soon it was set;There grows it ever,

모모There blooms it yet.

모모1815.*-----LIKE AND LIKE.

모모A FAIR bell-flower

모모Sprang tip from the ground;And early its fragrance

모모It shed all around;A bee came thither

모모And sipp'd from its bell;That they for each other

모모Were made, we see well.

모모1814.-----RECIPROCAL INVITATION TO THE DANCE.

모모THE INDIFFERENT.

모모COME to the dance with me, come with me, fair one!

모모Dances a feast-day like this may well crown.If thou my sweetheart art not, thou canst be so,

모모But if thou wilt not, we still will dance on.Come to the dance with me, come with me, fair one!

모모Dances a feast-day like this may well crown.

모모THE TENDER.

모모Loved one, without thee, what then would all feast be?

모모Sweet one, without thee, what then were the dance?If thou my sweetheart wert not, I would dance not.

모모If thou art still so, all life is one feast.Loved one, without thee, what then would all feasts be?

모모Sweet one, without thee, what then were the dance?

모모THE INDIFFERENT.

모모Let them but love, then, and leave us the dancing!

모모Languishing love cannot bear the glad dance.Let us whirl round in the waltz's gay measure,

모모And let them steal to the dim-lighted wood.Let them but love, then, and leave us the dancing!

모모Languishing love cannot bear the glad dance.

모모THE TENDER.

모모Let them whirl round, then, and leave us to wander!

모모Wand'ring to love is a heavenly dance.Cupid, the near one, o'erhears their deriding,

모모Vengeance takes suddenly, vengeance takes soon.Let them whirl round, then, and leave us to wander!

모모Wand'ring to love is a heavenly dance.

모모1789.*-----SELF-DECEIT.

모모My neighbour's curtain, well I see,

모모Is moving to and fin.No doubt she's list'ning eagerly,

모모If I'm at home or no.

모모And if the jealous grudge I bore

모모And openly confess'd,Is nourish'd by me as before,

모모Within my inmost breast.

모모Alas! no fancies such as these

모모E'er cross'd the dear child's thoughts.I see 'tis but the ev'ning breeze

모모That with the curtain sports.

모모1803.-----DECLARATION OF WAR.

모모OH, would I resembled

모모The country girls fair,Who rosy-red ribbons

모모And yellow hats wear!

모모To believe I was pretty

모모I thought was allow'd;In the town I believed it

모모When by the youth vow'd.

모모Now that Spring hath return'd,

모모All my joys disappear;The girls of the country

모모Have lured him from here.

모모To change dress and figure,

모모Was needful I found,My bodice is longer,

모모My petticoat round.

모모My hat now is yellow.

모모My bodice like snow;The clover to sickle

모모With others I go.

모모Something pretty, e'er long

모모Midst the troop he explores;The eager boy signs me

모모To go within doors.

모모I bashfully go,--

모모Who I am, he can't trace;He pinches my cheeks,

모모And he looks in my face.

모모The town girl now threatens

모모You maidens with war;Her twofold charms pledges .

모모Of victory are.

모모1803.-----LOVER IN ALL SHAPES.

모모To be like a fish,Brisk and quick, is my wish;If thou cam'st with thy line.Thou wouldst soon make me thine.To be like a fish,Brisk and quick, is my wish.

모모Oh, were I a steed!Thou wouldst love me indeed.Oh, were I a carFit to bear thee afar!Oh, were I a steed!Thou wouldst love me indeed.

모모I would I were goldThat thy fingers might hold!If thou boughtest aught then,I'd return soon again.I would I were goldThat thy fingers might hold!

모모I would I were true,And my sweetheart still new!To be faithful I'd swear,And would go away ne'er.I would I were true,And my sweetheart still new!

모모I would I were old,And wrinkled and cold,So that if thou said'st No,I could stand such a blow!I would I were old,And wrinkled and cold.

모모An ape I would be,Full of mischievous glee;If aught came to vex thee,I'd plague and perplex thee.An ape I would be,Full of mischievous glee

모모As a lamb I'd behave,As a lion be brave,As a lynx clearly see,As a fox cunning be.As a lamb I'd behave,As a lion be brave.

모모Whatever I were,All on thee I'd confer;With the gifts of a princeMy affection evince.Whatever I were,All on thee I'd confer.

모모As nought diff'rent can make me,As I am thou must take me!If I'm not good enough,Thou must cut thine own stuff.As nought diff'rent can make me,As I am thou must take me!

모모1815.*-----THE GOLDSMITH'S APPRENTICE.

모모My neighbour, none can e'er deny,

모모Is a most beauteous maid;Her shop is ever in mine eye,

모모When working at my trade.

모모To ring and chain I hammer then

모모The wire of gold assay'd,And think the while: "For Kate, oh when

모모Will such a ring be made?"

모모And when she takes her shutters down,

모모Her shop at once invade,To buy and haggle, all the town,

모모For all that's there displayd.

모모I file, and maybe overfile

모모The wire of gold assay'd;My master grumbles all the while,--

모모Her shop the mischief made.

모모To ply her wheel she straight begins,

모모When not engaged in trade;I know full well for what she spins,--

모모'Tis hope guides that dear maid.

모모Her leg, while her small foot treads on,

모모Is in my mind portray'd;Her garter I recall anon,--

모모I gave it that dear maid.

모모Then to her lips the finest thread

모모Is by her hand convey'd.Were I there only in its stead,

모모How I would kiss the maid!

모모1808.-----ANSWERS IN A GAME OF QUESTIONS.

모모THE LADY.

모모IN the small and great world too,

모모What most charms a woman's heart?It is doubtless what is new,

모모For its blossoms joy impart;Nobler far is what is true,

모모For fresh blossoms it can shoot

모모Even in the time of fruit.

모모THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN.

모모With the Nymphs in wood and cave

모모Paris was acquainted well,Till Zeus sent, to make him rave,

모모Three of those in Heav'n who dwell;And the choice more trouble gave

모모Than e'er fell to mortal lot,

모모Whether in old times or not.

모모THE EXPERIENCED.

모모Tenderly a woman view,

모모And thoult win her, take my word;He who's quick and saucy too,

모모Will of all men be preferr'd;Who ne'er seems as if he knew

모모If he pleases, if he charms,--

모모He 'tis injures, he 'tis harms.

모모THE CONTENTED.

모모Manifold is human strife,

모모Human passion, human pain;Many a blessing yet is rife,

모모Many pleasures still remain.Yet the greatest bliss in life,

모모And the richest prize we find,

모모Is a good, contented mind.

모모THE MERRY COUNSEL.

모모He by whom man's foolish will

모모Is each day review'd and blamed,Who, when others fools are still,

모모Is himself a fool proclaim'd,--Ne'er at mill was beast's back press'd

모모With a heavier load than he.What I feel within my breast

모모That in truth's the thing for me!

모모1789.-----DIFFERENT EMOTIONS ON THE SAME SPOT.

모모THE MAIDEN.

모모I'VE seen him before me!What rapture steals o'er me!

모모Oh heavenly sight!He's coming to meet me;Perplex'd, I retreat me,

모모With shame take to flight.My mind seems to wander!Ye rocks and trees yonder,

모모Conceal ye my rapture.

모모Conceal my delight!

모모THE YOUTH.

모모'Tis here I must find her,'Twas here she enshrined her,

모모Here vanish'd from sight.She came, as to meet me,Then fearing to greet me,

모모With shame took to flight.Is't hope? Do I wander?Ye rocks and trees yonder,

모모Disclose ye the loved one,

모모Disclose my delight!

모모THE LANGUISHING.

모모O'er my sad, fate I sorrow,To each dewy morrow,

모모Veil'd here from man's sightBy the many mistaken,Unknown and forsaken,

모모Here I wing my flight!Compassionate spirit!Let none ever hear it,--

모모Conceal my affliction,

모모Conceal thy delight!

모모THE HUNTER.

모모To-day I'm rewarded;Rich booty's afforded

모모By Fortune so bright.My servant the pheasants,And hares fit for presents

모모Takes homeward at night;Here see I enrapturedIn nets the birds captured!--

모모Long life to the hunter!

모모Long live his delight!

모모1789.-----WHO'LL BUY GODS OF LOVE?

모모OF all the beauteous waresExposed for sale at fairs,None will give more delightThan those that to your sightFrom distant lands we bring.Oh, hark to what we sing!These beauteous birds behold,They're brought here to be sold.

모모And first the big one see,So full of roguish glee!With light and merry boundHe leaps upon the ground;Then springs up on the bougd,We will not praise him now.The merry bird behold,--He's brought here to be sold.

모모And now the small one see!A modest look has he,And yet he's such apotherAs his big roguish brother.'Tis chiefly when all's stillHe loves to show his will.The bird so small and bold,--He's brought here to be sold.

모모Observe this little love,This darling turtle dove!All maidens are so neat,So civil, so discreetLet them their charms set loose,And turn your love to use;The gentle bird behold,--She's brought here to be sold.

모모Their praises we won't tell;They'll stand inspection well.They're fond of what is new,--And yet, to show they're true,Nor seal nor letter's wanted;To all have wings been granted.The pretty birds behold,--Such beauties ne'er were sold!

모모1795.-----THE MISANTHROPE.

모모AT first awhile sits he,

모모With calm, unruffled brow;His features then I see,Distorted hideously,--

모모An owl's they might be now.

모모What is it, askest thou?Is't love, or is't ennui?

모모'Tis both at once, I vow.

모모1767-9.-----DIFFERENT THREATS.

모모I ONCE into a forest far

모모My maiden went to seek,And fell upon her neck, when: "Ah!"

모모She threaten'd, "I will shriek!"

모모Then cried I haughtily: "I'll crush

모모The man that dares come near thee!""Hush!" whisper'd she: "My loved one, hush!

모모Or else they'll overhear thee!"

모모1767-9.-----MAIDEN WISHES.

모모WHAT pleasure to meA bridegroom would be!When married we are,They call us mamma.No need then to sew,To school we ne'er go;Command uncontroll'd,Have maids, whom to scold;Choose clothes at our ease,Of what tradesmen we please;Walk freely about,And go to each rout,And unrestrained areBy papa or mamma.

모모1767-9.-----MOTIVES.

모모IF to a girl who loves us trulyHer mother gives instruction dulyIn virtue, duty, and what not,--And if she hearkens ne'er a jot,But with fresh-strengthen'd longing flies

모모To meet our kiss that seems to burn,--

모모Caprice has just as much concernedAs love in her bold enterprise.

모모But if her mother can succeedIn gaining for her maxims heed,And softening the girl's heart too,So that she coyly shuns our view,--The heart of youth she knows but ill;

모모For when a maiden is thus stern,

모모Virtue in truth has less concernIn this, than an inconstant will.

모모1767-9.-----TRUE ENJOYMENT.

모모VAINLY wouldst thou, to gain a heart,

모모Heap up a maiden's lap with gold;The joys of love thou must impart,

모모Wouldst thou e'er see those joys unfold.The voices of the throng gold buys,

모모No single heart 'twill win for thee;Wouldst thou a maiden make thy prize,

모모Thyself alone the bribe must be.

모모If by no sacred tie thou'rt bound,

모모Oh youth, thou must thyself restrain!Well may true liberty be found,

모모Tho' man may seem to wear a chain.Let one alone inflame thee e'er,

모모And if her heart with love o'erflows,Let tenderness unite you there,

모모If duty's self no fetter knows.

모모First feel, oh youth! A girl then find

모모Worthy thy choice,--let her choose thee,In body fair, and fair in mind,

모모And then thou wilt be blessed, like me.I who have made this art mine own,

모모A girl have chosen such as thisThe blessing of the priest alone

모모Is wanting to complete our bliss.

모모Nought but my rapture is her guide,

모모Only for me she cares to please,--Ne'er wanton save when by my side,

모모And modest when the world she sees;That time our glow may never chill,

모모She yields no right through frailty;Her favour is a favour still,

모모And I must ever grateful be.

모모Yet I'm content, and full of joy,

모모If she'll but grant her smile so sweet,Or if at table she'll employ,

모모To pillow hers, her lover's feet,Give me the apple that she bit,

모모The glass from which she drank, bestow,And when my kiss so orders it,

모모Her bosom, veil'd till then, will show.

모모And when she wills of love to speak,

모모In fond and silent hours of bliss,Words from her mouth are all I seek,

모모Nought else I crave,--not e'en a kiss.With what a soul her mind is fraught,

모모Wreath'd round with charms unceasingly!She's perfect,--and she fails in nought

모모Save in her deigning to love me.

모모My rev'rence throws me at her feet,

모모My longing throws me on her breast;This, youth, is rapture true and sweet,

모모Be wise, thus seeking to be blest.When death shall take thee from her side,

모모To join the angelic choir above,In heaven's bright mansions to abide,--No diff'rence at the change thoult prove.

모모1767-8.-----THE FAREWELL.

모모[Probably addressed to his mistress Frederica.]

모모LET mine eye the farewell say,

모모That my lips can utter ne'er;Fain I'd be a man to-day,

모모Yet 'tis hard, oh, hard to bear!

모모Mournful in an hour like this

모모Is love's sweetest pledge, I ween;Cold upon thy mouth the kiss,

모모Faint thy fingers' pressure e'en.

모모Oh what rapture to my heart

모모Used each stolen kiss to bring!As the violets joy impart,

모모Gather'd in the early spring.

모모Now no garlands I entwine,

모모Now no roses pluck. for thee,Though 'tis springtime, Fanny mine,

모모Dreary autumn 'tis to me!

모모1771.-----THE BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.

모모Now I leave this cottage lowly,

모모Where my love hath made her home,And with silent footstep slowly

모모Through the darksome forest roam,Luna breaks through oaks and bushes,

모모Zephyr hastes her steps to meet,And the waving birch-tree blushes,

모모Scattering round her incense sweet.

모모Grateful are the cooling breezes

모모Of this beauteous summer night,Here is felt the charm that pleases,

모모And that gives the soul delight.Boundless is my joy; yet, Heaven,

모모Willingly I'd leave to theeThousand such nights, were one given

모모By my maiden loved to me!

모모1767-8.-----HAPPINESS AND VISION.

모모TOGETHER at the altar weIn vision oft were seen by thee,

모모Thyself as bride, as bridegroom I.Oft from thy mouth full many a kissIn an unguarded hour of bliss

모모I then would steal, while none were by.

모모The purest rapture we then knew,The joy those happy hours gave too,

모모When tasted, fled, as time fleets on.What now avails my joy to me?Like dreams the warmest kisses flee,

모모Like kisses, soon all joys are gone.

모모1767-8.-----LIVING REMEMBRANCE.

모모HALF vex'd, half pleased, thy love will feel,Shouldst thou her knot or ribbon steal;To thee they're much--I won't conceal;

모모Such self-deceit may pardon'd be;A veil, a kerchief, garter, rings,In truth are no mean trifling things,

모모But still they're not enough for me.

모모She who is dearest to my heart,Gave me, with well dissembled smart,Of her own life, a living part,

모모No charm in aught beside I trace;How do I scorn thy paltry ware!A lock she gave me of the hair

모모That wantons o'er her beauteous face.

모모If, loved one, we must sever'd be,Wouldst thou not wholly fly from me,I still possess this legacy,

모모To look at, and to kiss in play.--My fate is to the hair's allied,We used to woo her with like pride,

모모And now we both are far away.

모모Her charms with equal joy we press'd,Her swelling cheeks anon caress'd,Lured onward by a yearning blest,

모모Upon her heaving bosom fell.Oh rival, free from envy's sway,Thou precious gift, thou beauteous prey.

모모Remain my joy and bliss to tell!

모모1767-9.-----THE BLISS OF ABSENCE.

모모DRINK, oh youth, joy's purest rayFrom thy loved one's eyes all day,

모모And her image paint at night!Better rule no lover knows,Yet true rapture greater grows,

모모When far sever'd from her sight.

모모Powers eternal, distance, time,Like the might of stars sublime,

모모Gently rock the blood to rest,O'er my senses softness steals,Yet my bosom lighter feels,

모모And I daily am more blest.

모모Though I can forget her ne'er,Yet my mind is free from care,

모모I can calmly live and move;Unperceived infatuationLonging turns to adoration,

모모Turns to reverence my love.

모모Ne'er can cloud, however light,Float in ether's regions bright,

모모When drawn upwards by the sun,As my heart in rapturous calm.Free from envy and alarm,

모모Ever love I her alone!

모모1767-9.-----TO LUNA.

모모SISTER of the first-born light,

모모Type of sorrowing gentleness!

모모Quivering mists in silv'ry dressFloat around thy features bright;When thy gentle foot is heard,

모모From the day-closed caverns then

모모Wake the mournful ghosts of men,I, too, wake, and each night-bird.

모모O'er a field of boundless span

모모Looks thy gaze both far and wide.

모모Raise me upwards to thy side!Grant this to a raving man!And to heights of rapture raised,

모모Let the knight so crafty peep

모모At his maiden while asleep,Through her lattice-window glazed.

모모Soon the bliss of this sweet view,

모모Pangs by distance caused allays;

모모And I gather all thy rays,And my look I sharpen too.Round her unveil'd limbs I see

모모Brighter still become the glow,

모모And she draws me down below,As Endymion once drew thee.

모모1767-9.-----THE WEDDING NIGHT.

모모WITHIN the chamber, far away

모모From the glad feast, sits Love in dreadLest guests disturb, in wanton play,

모모The silence of the bridal bed.His torch's pale flame serves to gild

모모The scene with mystic sacred glow;The room with incense-clouds is fil'd,

모모That ye may perfect rapture know.

모모How beats thy heart, when thou dost hear

모모The chime that warns thy guests to fly!How glow'st thou for those lips so dear,

모모That soon are mute, and nought deny!With her into the holy place

모모Thou hast'nest then, to perfect all;The fire the warder's hands embrace,

모모Grows, like a night-light, dim and small.

모모How heaves her bosom, and how burns

모모Her face at every fervent kiss!Her coldness now to trembling turns,

모모Thy daring now a duty is.Love helps thee to undress her fast,

모모But thou art twice as fast as he;And then he shuts both eye at last,

모모With sly and roguish modesty.

모모1767.-----MISCHIEVOUS JOY.

모모AS a butterfly renew'd,

모모When in life I breath'd my last,

모모To the spots my flight I wing,

모모Scenes of heav'nly rapture past,

모모Over meadows, to the spring,Round the hill, and through the wood.

모모Soon a tender pair I spy,

모모And I look down from my seat

모모On the beauteous maiden's head--

모모When embodied there I meet

모모All I lost as soon as dead,Happy as before am I.

모모Him she clasps with silent smile,

모모And his mouth the hour improves,

모모Sent by kindly Deities;

모모First from breast to mouth it roves,

모모Then from mouth to hands it flies,And I round him sport the while.

모모And she sees me hov'ring near;

모모Trembling at her lovers rapture,

모모Up she springs--I fly away,

모모"Dearest! let's the insect capture

모모Come! I long to make my preyYonder pretty little dear!"

모모1767-9.-----APPARENT DEATH.

모모WEEP, maiden, weep here o'er the tomb of Love;

모모He died of nothing--by mere chance was slain.But is he really dead?--oh, that I cannot prove:

모모A nothing, a mere chance, oft gives him life again.

모모1767-9.-----NOVEMBER SONG.

모모To the great archer--not to him

모모To meet whom flies the sun,And who is wont his features dim

모모With clouds to overrun--

모모But to the boy be vow'd these rhymes,

모모Who 'mongst the roses plays,Who hear us, and at proper times

모모To pierce fair hearts essays.

모모Through him the gloomy winter night,

모모Of yore so cold and drear,Brings many a loved friend to our sight,

모모And many a woman dear.

모모Henceforward shall his image fair

모모Stand in yon starry skies,And, ever mild and gracious there,

모모Alternate set and rise.

모모1815.*-----TO THE CHOSEN ONE.[This sweet song is doubtless one of those addressed toFrederica.]

모모HAND in hand! and lip to lip!

모모Oh, be faithful, maiden dear!Fare thee well! thy lover's ship

모모Past full many a rock must steersBut should he the haven see,

모모When the storm has ceased to break,And be happy, reft of thee,--

모모May the Gods fierce vengeance take!

모모Boldly dared is well nigh won!

모모Half my task is solved aright;Ev'ry star's to me a sun,

모모Only cowards deem it night.Stood I idly by thy side,

모모Sorrow still would sadden me;But when seas our paths divide,

모모Gladly toil I,--toil for thee!

모모Now the valley I perceive,

모모Where together we will go,And the streamlet watch each eve,

모모Gliding peacefully belowOh, the poplars on yon spot!

모모Oh, the beech trees in yon grove!And behind we'll build a cot,

모모Where to taste the joys of love!

모모1771.-----FIRST LOSS.

모모AH! who'll e'er those days restore,

모모Those bright days of early loveWho'll one hour again concede,

모모Of that time so fondly cherish'd!Silently my wounds I feed,And with wailing evermore

모모Sorrow o'er each joy now perish'd.Ah! who'll e'er the days restore

모모Of that time so fondly cherish'd.

모모1789.*-----AFTER-SENSATIONS.

모모WHEN the vine again is blowing,

모모Then the wine moves in the cask;When the rose again is glowing,

모모Wherefore should I feel oppress'd?

모모Down my cheeks run tears all-burning,

모모If I do, or leave my task;I but feel a speechless yearning,

모모That pervades my inmost breast.

모모But at length I see the reason,

모모When the question I would ask:'Twas in such a beauteous season,

모모Doris glowed to make me blest!

모모1797.-----PROXIMITY OF THE BELOVED ONE.

모모I THINK of thee, whene'er the sun his beams

모모O'er ocean flings;I think  of thee, whene'er the moonlight gleams

모모In silv'ry springs.

모모I see thee, when upon the distant ridge

모모The dust awakes;At midnight's hour, when on the fragile bridge

모모The wanderer quakes.

모모I hear thee, when yon billows rise on high,

모모With murmur deep.To tread the silent grove oft wander I,

모모When all's asleep.

모모I'm near thee, though thou far away mayst be--

모모Thou, too, art near!The sun then sets, the stars soon lighten me.

모모Would thou wert here!

모모1795.-----PRESENCE.

모모ALL things give token of thee!As soon as the bright sun is shining,Thou too wilt follow, I trust.

모모When in the garden thou walk'st,Thou then art the rose of all roses,Lily of lilies as well.

모모When thou dost move in the dance,Then each constellation moves also;With thee and round thee they move.

모모Night! oh, what bliss were the night!For then thou o'ershadow'st the lustre,Dazzling and fair, of the moon.

모모Dazzling and beauteous art thou,And flowers, and moon, and the planetsHomage pay, Sun, but to thee.

모모Sun! to me also be thouCreator of days bright and glorious;Life and Eternity this!

모모1813.-----TO THE DISTANT ONE.

모모AND have I lost thee evermore?

모모Hast thou, oh fair one, from me flown?Still in mine ear sounds, as of yore,

모모Thine ev'ry word, thine ev'ry tone.

모모As when at morn the wand'rer's eye

모모Attempts to pierce the air in vain,When, hidden in the azure sky,

모모The lark high o'er him chaunts his strain:

모모So do I cast my troubled gaze

모모Through bush, through forest, o'er the lea;Thou art invoked by all my lays;

모모Oh, come then, loved one, back to me!

모모1789.*-----BY THE RIVER.

모모FLOW on, ye lays so loved, so fair,

모모On to Oblivion's ocean flow!May no rapt boy recall you e'er,

모모No maiden in her beauty's glow!

모모My love alone was then your theme,

모모But now she scorns my passion true.Ye were but written in the stream;

모모As it flows on, then, flow ye too!

모모1798.*-----FAREWELL.

모모To break one's word is pleasure-fraught,

모모To do one's duty gives a smart;While man, alas! will promise nought,

모모That is repugnant to his heart.

모모Using some magic strains of yore,

모모Thou lurest him, when scarcely calm,On to sweet folly's fragile bark once more,

모모Renewing, doubling chance of harm.

모모Why seek to hide thyself from me?

모모Fly not my sight--be open then!Known late or early it must be,

모모And here thou hast thy word again.

모모My duty is fulfill'd to-day,

모모No longer will I guard thee from surprise;But, oh, forgive the friend who from thee turns away,

모모And to himself for refuge flies!

모모1797.-----THE EXCHANGE.

모모THE stones in the streamlet I make my bright pillow,And open my arms to the swift-rolling billow,

모모That lovingly hastens to fall on my breast.Then fickleness soon bids it onwards be flowing;A second draws nigh, its caresses bestowing,--

모모And so by a twofold enjoyment I'm blest.

모모And yet thou art trailing in sorrow and sadnessThe moments that life, as it flies, gave for gladness,

모모Because by thy love thou'rt remember'd no more!Oh, call back to mind former days and their blisses!The lips of the second will give as sweet kisses

모모As any the lips of the first gave before!

모모1767-9.-----WELCOME AND FAREWELL.

모모[Another of the love-songs addressed to Frederica.]

모모QUICK throbb'd my heart: to norse! haste, haste,

모모And lo! 'twas done with speed of light;The evening soon the world embraced,

모모And o'er the mountains hung the night.Soon stood, in robe of mist, the oak,

모모A tow'ring giant in his size,Where darkness through the thicket broke,

모모And glared with hundred gloomy eyes.

모모From out a hill of clouds the moon

모모With mournful gaze began to peer:The winds their soft wings flutter'd soon,

모모And murmur'd in mine awe-struck ear;The night a thousand monsters made,

모모Yet fresh and joyous was my mind;What fire within my veins then play'd!

모모What glow was in my bosom shrin'd!

모모I saw thee, and with tender pride

모모Felt thy sweet gaze pour joy on me;While all my heart was at thy side.

모모And every breath I breath'd for thee.The roseate hues that spring supplies

모모Were playing round thy features fair,And love for me--ye Deities!

모모I hoped it, I deserved it ne'er!

모모But, when the morning sun return'd,

모모Departure filled with grief my heart:Within thy kiss, what rapture burn'd!

모모But in thy look, what bitter smart!I went--thy gaze to earth first roved

모모Thou follow'dst me with tearful eye:And yet, what rapture to be loved!

모모And, Gods, to love--what ecstasy!

모모1771.-----NEW LOVE, NEW LIFE.

모모[Written at the time of Goethe's connection with Lily.]

모모HEART! my heart! what means this feeling?

모모What oppresseth thee so sore?What strange life is o'er me stealing!

모모I acknowledge thee no more.Fled is all that gave thee gladness,Fled the cause of all thy sadness,

모모Fled thy peace, thine industry--

모모Ah, why suffer it to be?

모모Say, do beauty's graces youthful,

모모Does this form so fair and bright,Does this gaze, so kind, so truthful,

모모Chain thee with unceasing might?Would I tear me from her boldly,Courage take, and fly her coldly,

모모Back to her. I'm forthwith led

모모By the path I seek to tread.

모모By a thread I ne'er can sever,

모모For 'tis 'twined with magic skill,Doth the cruel maid for ever

모모Hold me fast against my will.While those magic chains confine me,To her will I must resign me.

모모Ah, the change in truth is great!

모모Love! kind love! release me straight!

모모1775.-----TO BELINDA.

모모[This song was also written for Lily. Goethe mentions, at the endof his Autobiography, that he overheard her singing it oneevening after he had taken his last farewell of her.]

모모WHEREFORE drag me to yon glittering eddy,

모모With resistless might?Was I, then, not truly blest already

모모In the silent night?

모모In my secret chamber refuge taking,

모모'Neath the moon's soft ray,And her awful light around me breaking,

모모Musing there I lay.

모모And I dream'd of hours with joy o'erflowing,

모모Golden, truly blest,While thine image so beloved was glowing

모모Deep within my breast.

모모Now to the card-table hast thou bound me,

모모'Midst the torches glare?Whilst unhappy faces are around me,

모모Dost thou hold me there?

모모Spring-flow'rs are to me more rapture-giving,

모모Now conceal'd from view;Where thou, angel, art, is Nature living,

모모Love and kindness too.

모모1775.-----MAY SONG.

모모How fair doth Nature

모모Appear again!How bright the sunbeams!

모모How smiles the plain!

모모The flow'rs are bursting

모모From ev'ry bough,And thousand voices

모모Each bush yields now.

모모And joy and gladness

모모Fill ev'ry breast!Oh earth!--oh sunlight!

모모Oh rapture blest!

모모Oh love! oh loved one!

모모As golden bright,As clouds of morning

모모On yonder height!

모모Thou blessest gladly

모모The smiling field,--The world in fragrant

모모Vapour conceal'd.

모모Oh maiden, maiden,

모모How love I thee!Thine eye, how gleams it!

모모How lov'st thou me!

모모The blithe lark loveth

모모Sweet song and air,The morning flow'ret

모모Heav'n's incense fair,

모모As I now love thee

모모With fond desire,For thou dost give me

모모Youth, joy, and fire,

모모For new-born dances

모모And minstrelsy.Be ever happy,

모모As thou lov'st me!

모모1775.*-----WITH A PAINTED RIBBON.

모모LITTLE leaves and flow'rets too,

모모Scatter we with gentle hand,Kind young spring-gods to the view,

모모Sporting on an airy band.

모모Zephyr, bear it on the wing,

모모Twine it round my loved one's dress;To her glass then let her spring,

모모Full of eager joyousness.

모모Roses round her let her see,

모모She herself a youthful rose.Grant, dear life, one look to me!

모모'Twill repay me all my woes,

모모What this bosom feels, feel thou.

모모Freely offer me thy hand;Let the band that joins us now

모모Be no fragile rosy band!

모모1770.-----WITH A GOLDEN NECKLACE.

모모THIS page a chain to bring thee burns,

모모That, train'd to suppleness of old,On thy fair neck to nestle, yearns,

모모In many a hundred little fold.

모모To please the silly thing consent!

모모'Tis harmless, and from boldness free;By day a trifling ornament,

모모At night 'tis cast aside by thee.

모모But if the chain they bring thee ever,

모모Heavier, more fraught with weal or woe,I'd then, Lisette, reproach thee never

모모If thou shouldst greater scruples show.

모모1775.*-----ON THE LAKE,

모모[Written on the occasion of Goethe's starting with his friendPassavant on a Swiss Tour.]

모모I DRINK fresh nourishment, new blood

모모From out this world more free;The Nature is so kind and good

모모That to her breast clasps me!The billows toss our bark on high,

모모And with our oars keep time,While cloudy mountains tow'rd the sky

모모Before our progress climb.

모모Say, mine eye, why sink'st thou down?Golden visions, are ye flown?

모모Hence, thou dream, tho' golden-twin'd;

모모Here, too, love and life I find.

모모Over the waters are blinking

모모Many a thousand fair star;Gentle mists are drinking

모모Round the horizon afar.Round the shady creek lightly

모모Morning zephyrs awake,And the ripen'd fruit brightly

모모Mirrors itself in the lake.

모모1775.-----FROM THE MOUNTAIN.

모모[Written just after the preceding one, on a mountain overlookingthe Lake of Zurich.]

모모IF I, dearest Lily, did not love thee,

모모How this prospect would enchant my sight!And yet if I, Lily, did not love thee,

모모Could I find, or here, or there, delight?

모모1775.-----FLOWER-SALUTE.

모모THIS nosegay,--'twas I dress'd it,--

모모Greets thee a thousand times!Oft stoop'd I, and caress'd it,

모모Ah! full a thousand times,And 'gainst my bosom press'd it

모모A hundred thousand times!

모모1815.*-----IN SUMMER.

모모How plain and heightWith dewdrops are bright!How pearls have crown'dThe plants all around!How sighs the breezeThro' thicket and trees!How loudly in the sun's clear raysThe sweet birds carol forth their lays!

모모But, ah! above,Where saw I my love,Within her room,Small, mantled in gloom,Enclosed around,Where sunlight was drown'd,How little there was earth to me,With all its beauteous majesty!

모모1776.*-----MAY SONG.

모모BETWEEN wheatfield and corn,Between hedgerow and thorn,Between pasture and tree,Where's my sweetheartTell it me!

모모Sweetheart caught I

모모Not at home;She's then, thought I.

모모Gone to roam.Fair and loving

모모Blooms sweet May;Sweetheart's roving,

모모Free and gay.

모모By the rock near the wave,Where her first kiss she gave,On the greensward, to me,--Something I see!Is it she?

모모1812.-----PREMATURE SPRING.

모모DAYS full of rapture,

모모Are ye renew'd ?--Smile in the sunlight

모모Mountain and wood?

모모Streams richer laden

모모Flow through the dale,Are these the meadows?

모모Is this the vale?

모모Coolness cerulean!

모모Heaven and height!Fish crowd the ocean,

모모Golden and bright.

모모Birds of gay plumage

모모Sport in the grove,Heavenly numbers

모모Singing above.

모모Under the verdure's

모모Vigorous bloom,Bees, softly bumming,

모모Juices consume.

모모Gentle disturbance

모모Quivers in air,Sleep-causing fragrance,

모모Motion so fair.

모모Soon with more power

모모Rises the breeze,Then in a moment

모모Dies in the trees.

모모But to the bosom

모모Comes it again.Aid me, ye Muses,

모모Bliss to sustain!

모모Say what has happen'd

모모Since yester e'en?Oh, ye fair sisters,

모모Her I have seen!

모모1802.-----AUTUMN FEELINGS.

모모FLOURISH greener, as ye clamber,Oh ye leaves, to seek my chamber,

모모Up the trellis'd vine on high!May ye swell, twin-berries tender,Juicier far,--and with more splendour

모모Ripen, and more speedily!O'er ye broods the sun at evenAs he sinks to rest, and heaven

모모Softly breathes into your earAll its fertilising fullness,While the moon's refreshing coolness,

모모Magic-laden, hovers near;And, alas! ye're watered ever

모모By a stream of tears that rillFrom mine eyes--tears ceasing never,

모모Tears of love that nought can still!

모모1775.*-----RESTLESS LOVE.

모모THROUGH rain, through snow,Through tempest go!'Mongst streaming caves,O'er misty waves,On, on! still on!Peace, rest have flown!

모모Sooner through sadness

모모I'd wish to be slain,Than all the gladness

모모Of life to sustainAll the fond yearning

모모That heart feels for heart,Only seems burning

모모To make them both smart.

모모How shall I fly?Forestwards hie?Vain were all strife!Bright crown of life.Turbulent bliss,--Love, thou art this!

모모1789.-----THE SHEPHERD'S LAMENT.

모모ON yonder lofty mountain

모모A thousand times I stand,And on my staff reclining,

모모Look down on the smiling land.

모모My grazing flocks then I follow,

모모My dog protecting them well;I find myself in the valley,

모모But how, I scarcely can tell.

모모The whole of the meadow is cover'd

모모With flowers of beauty rare;I pluck them, but pluck them unknowing

모모To whom the offering to bear.

모모In rain and storm and tempest,

모모I tarry beneath the tree,But closed remaineth yon portal;

모모'Tis all but a vision to me.

모모High over yonder dwelling,

모모There rises a rainbow gay;But she from home hath departed

모모And wander'd far, far away.

모모Yes, far away bath she wander'd,

모모Perchance e'en over the sea;Move onward, ye sheep, then, move onward!

모모Full sad the shepherd must be.

모모1803.*-----COMFORT IN TEARS.

모모How happens it that thou art sad,

모모While happy all appear?Thine eye proclaims too well that thou

모모Hast wept full many a tear.

모모"If I have wept in solitude,

모모None other shares my grief,And tears to me sweet balsam are,

모모And give my heart relief."

모모Thy happy friends invite thee now,--

모모Oh come, then, to our breast!And let the loss thou hast sustain'd

모모Be there to us confess'd!

모모"Ye shout, torment me, knowing not

모모What 'tis afflicteth me;Ah no! I have sustained no loss,

모모Whate'er may wanting be."

모모If so it is, arise in haste!

모모Thou'rt young and full of life.At years like thine, man's blest with strength.

모모And courage for the strife.

모모"Ah no! in vain 'twould be to strive,

모모The thing I seek is far;It dwells as high, it gleams as fair

모모As yonder glitt'ring star."

모모The stars we never long to clasp,

모모We revel in their light,And with enchantment upward gaze,

모모Each clear and radiant night.

모모"And I with rapture upward gaze,

모모On many a blissful day;Then let me pass the night in tears,

모모Till tears are wip'd away!

모모1803.*-----NIGHT SONG,

모모WHEN on thy pillow lying,

모모Half listen, I implore,And at my lute's soft sighing,

모모Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?

모모For at my lute's soft sighing

모모The stars their blessings pourOn feelings never-dying;

모모Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?

모모Those feelings never-dying

모모My spirit aid to soarFrom earthly conflicts trying;

모모Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?

모모From earthly conflicts trying

모모Thou driv'st me to this shore;Through thee I'm thither flying,--

모모Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?

모모Through thee I'm hither flying,

모모Thou wilt not list beforeIn slumbers thou art lying:

모모Sleep on! what wouldst thou more?

모모1803.*-----LONGING.

모모WHAT pulls at my heart so?

모모What tells me to roam?What drags me and lures me

모모From chamber and home?How round the cliffs gather

모모The clouds high in air!I fain would go thither,

모모I fain would be there!

모모The sociable flight

모모Of the ravens comes back;I mingle amongst them,

모모And follow their track.Round wall and round mountain

모모Together we fly;She tarries below there,

모모I after her spy.

모모Then onward she wanders,

모모My flight I wing soonTo the wood fill'd with bushes,

모모A bird of sweet tune.She tarries and hearkens,

모모And smiling, thinks she:"How sweetly he's singing!

모모He's singing to me!"

모모The heights are illum'd

모모By the fast setting sun;The pensive fair maiden

모모Looks thoughtfully on;She roams by the streamlet,

모모O'er meadows she goes,And darker and darker

모모The pathway fast grows.

모모I rise on a sudden,

모모A glimmering star;"What glitters above me,

모모So near and so far?"

모모And when thou with wonder

모모Hast gazed on the light,I fall down before thee,

모모Entranced by thy sight!

모모1803.-----TO MIGNON.

모모OVER vale and torrent farRolls along the sun's bright car.Ah! he wakens in his course

모모Mine, as thy deep-seated smart

모모In the heart.Ev'ry morning with new force.

모모Scarce avails night aught to me;E'en the visions that I seeCome but in a mournful guise;

모모And I feel this silent smart

모모In my heartWith creative pow'r arise.

모모During many a beauteous yearI have seen ships 'neath me steer,As they seek the shelt'ring bay;

모모But, alas, each lasting smart

모모In my heartFloats not with the stream away.

모모I must wear a gala dress,Long stored up within my press,For to-day to feasts is given;

모모None know with what bitter smart

모모Is my heartFearfully and madly riven.

모모Secretly I weep each tear,Yet can cheerful e'en appear,With a face of healthy red;

모모For if deadly were this silent smart

모모In my heart,Ah, I then had long been dead!-----THE MOUNTAIN CASTLE.

모모THERE stands on yonder high mountain

모모A castle built of yore,Where once lurked horse and horseman

모모In rear of gate and of door.

모모Now door and gate are in ashes,

모모And all around is so still;And over the fallen ruins

모모I clamber just as I will.

모모Below once lay a cellar,

모모With costly wines well stor'd;No more the glad maid with her pitcher

모모Descends there to draw from the hoard.

모모No longer the goblet she places

모모Before the guests at the feast;The flask at the meal so hallow'd

모모No longer she fills for the priest.

모모No more for the eager squire

모모The draught in the passage is pour'd;No more for the flying present

모모Receives she the flying reward.

모모For all the roof and the rafters,

모모They all long since have been burn'd,And stairs and passage and chapel

모모To rubbish and ruins are turn'd.

모모Yet when with lute and with flagon,

모모When day was smiling and bright,I've watch'd my mistress climbing

모모To gain this perilous height,

모모Then rapture joyous and radiant

모모The silence so desolate brake,And all, as in days long vanish'd,

모모Once more to enjoyment awoke;

모모As if for guests of high station

모모The largest rooms were prepared;As if from those times so precious

모모A couple thither had fared;

모모As if there stood in his chapel

모모The priest in his sacred dress,And ask'd: "Would ye twain be united?"

모모And we, with a smile, answer'd, "Yes!"

모모And songs that breath'd a deep feeling,

모모That touched the heart's innermost chord,The music-fraught mouth of sweet echo,

모모Instead of the many, outpour'd.

모모And when at eve all was hidden

모모In silence unbroken and deep,The glowing sun then look'd upwards,

모모And gazed on the summit so steep.

모모And squire and maiden then glitter'd

모모As bright and gay as a lord,She seized the time for her present,

모모And he to give her reward.

모모1803.*-----THE SPIRIT'S SALUTE.

모모THE hero's noble shade stands high

모모On yonder turret grey;And as the ship is sailing by,

모모He speeds it on his way.

모모"See with what strength these sinews thrill'd!

모모This heart, how firm and wild!These bones, what knightly marrow fill'd!

모모This cup, how bright it smil'd!

모모"Half of my life I strove and fought,

모모And half I calmly pass'd;And thou, oh ship with beings fraught,

모모Sail safely to the last!"

모모1774.-----TO A GOLDEN HEART THAT HE WORE ROUND HIS NECK.

모모[Addressed, during the Swiss tour already mentioned, to a presentLily had given him, during the time of their happy connection,which was then about to be terminated for ever.]

모모OH thou token loved of joys now perish'd

모모That I still wear from my neck suspended,Art thou stronger than our spirit-bond so cherish'd?

모모Or canst thou prolong love's days untimely ended?

모모Lily, I fly from thee! I still am doom'd to rangeThro' countries strange,

모모Thro' distant vales and woods, link'd on to thee!Ah, Lily's heart could surely never fall

모모So soon away from me!

모모As when a bird bath broken from his thrall,

모모And seeks the forest green,Proof of imprisonment he bears behind him,A morsel of the thread once used to bind him;

모모The free-born bird of old no more is seen,

모모For he another's prey bath been.

모모1775.-----THE BLISS OF SORROW.

모모NEVER dry, never dry,

모모Tears that eternal love sheddeth!How dreary, how dead doth the world still appear,When only half-dried on the eye is the tear!

모모Never dry, never dry,

모모Tears that unhappy love sheddeth!

모모1789.*-----THE WANDERER'S NIGHT-SONG.

모모THOU who comest from on high,

모모Who all woes and sorrows stillest,Who, for twofold misery,

모모Hearts with twofold balsam fillest,Would this constant strife would cease!

모모What are pain and rapture now?Blissful Peace,

모모To my bosom hasten thou!

모모1789.*-----THE SAME.

모모[Written at night on the Kickelhahn, a hill in the forest ofIlmenau, on the walls of a little hermitage where Goethe composedthe last act of his Iphigenia.]

모모HUSH'D on the hill

모모Is the breeze;

모모Scarce by the zephyr

모모The trees

모모Softly are press'd;The woodbird's asleep on the bough.Wait, then, and thou

모모Soon wilt find rest.

모모1783.-----THE HUNTER'S EVEN-SONG.

모모THE plain with still and wand'ring feet,

모모And gun full-charged, I tread,And hov'ring see thine image sweet,

모모Thine image dear, o'er head.

모모In gentle silence thou dost fare

모모Through field and valley dear;But doth my fleeting image ne'er

모모To thy mind's eye appear?

모모His image, who, by grief oppress'd,

모모Roams through the world forlorn,And wanders on from east to west,

모모Because from thee he's torn?

모모When I would think of none but thee,

모모Mine eyes the moon survey;A calm repose then steals o'er me,

모모But how, 'twere hard to say.

모모1776,*-----TO THE MOON.

모모BUSH and vale thou fill'st again

모모With thy misty ray,And my spirit's heavy chain

모모Castest far away.

모모Thou dost o'er my fields extend

모모Thy sweet soothing eye,Watching like a gentle friend,

모모O'er my destiny.

모모Vanish'd days of bliss and woe

모모Haunt me with their tone,Joy and grief in turns I know,

모모As I stray alone.

모모Stream beloved, flow on! flow on!

모모Ne'er can I be gay!Thus have sport and kisses gone,

모모Truth thus pass'd away.

모모Once I seem'd the lord to be

모모Of that prize so fair!Now, to our deep sorrow, we

모모Can forget it ne'er.

모모Murmur, stream, the vale along,

모모Never cease thy sighs;Murmur, whisper to my song

모모Answering melodies!

모모When thou in the winter's night

모모Overflow'st in wrath,Or in spring-time sparklest bright,

모모As the buds shoot forth.

모모He who from the world retires,

모모Void of hate, is blest;Who a friend's true love inspires,

모모Leaning on his breast!

모모That which heedless man ne'er knew,

모모Or ne'er thought aright,Roams the bosom's labyrinth through,

모모Boldly into night.

모모1789.*-----TO LINA.

모모SHOULD these songs, love, as they fleet,

모모Chance again to reach thy hand,At the piano take thy seat,

모모Where thy friend was wont to stand!

모모Sweep with finger bold the string,

모모Then the book one moment see:But read not! do nought but sing!

모모And each page thine own will be!

모모Ah, what grief the song imparts

모모With its letters, black on white,That, when breath'd by thee, our hearts

모모Now can break and now delight!

모모1800.*-----EVER AND EVERYWHERE.

모모FAR explore the mountain hollow,High in air the clouds then follow!

모모To each brook and vale the Muse

모모Thousand times her call renews.

모모Soon as a flow'ret blooms in spring,It wakens many a strain;

모모And when Time spreads his fleeting wing,

모모The seasons come again.

모모1820.*-----PETITION.

모모OH thou sweet maiden fair,Thou with the raven hair,

모모Why to the window go?

모모While gazing down below,Art standing vainly there?

모모Oh, if thou stood'st for me,And lett'st the latch but fly,

모모How happy should I be!How soon would I leap high!

모모1789.*-----TO HIS COY ONE.

모모SEEST thou yon smiling Orange?Upon the tree still hangs it;Already March bath vanish'd,And new-born flow'rs are shooting.I draw nigh to the tree then,And there I say: Oh Orange,Thou ripe and juicy Orange,Thou sweet and luscious Orange,I shake the tree, I shake it,Oh fall into my lap!

모모1789.*-----NIGHT THOUGHTS.

모모OH, unhappy stars! your fate I mourn,

모모Ye by whom the sea-toss'd sailor's lighted,Who with radiant beams the heav'ns adorn,

모모But by gods and men are unrequited:For ye love not,--ne'er have learnt to love!Ceaselessly in endless dance ye move,In the spacious sky your charms displaying,

모모What far travels ye have hasten'd through,Since, within my loved one's arms delaying,

모모I've forgotten you and midnight too!

모모1789.*-----TO LIDA.

모모THE only one whom, Lida, thou canst love,

모모Thou claim'st, and rightly claim'st, for only thee;He too is wholly thine; since doomed to rove

모모Far from thee, in life's turmoils nought I seeSave a thin veil, through which thy form I view,As though in clouds; with kindly smile and true,

모모It cheers me, like the stars eterne that gleamAcross the northern-lights' far-flick'ring beam.

모모1789.*-----PROXIMITY.

모모I KNOW not, wherefore, dearest love,

모모Thou often art so strange and coyWhen 'mongst man's busy haunts we move,

모모Thy coldness puts to flight my joy.But soon as night and silence round us reign,I know thee by thy kisses sweet again!

모모1789.*-----RECIPROCAL.

모모MY mistress, where sits she?

모모What is it that charms?The absent she's rocking,

모모Held fast in her arms.

모모In pretty cage prison'd

모모She holds a bird still;Yet lets him fly from her,

모모Whenever he will.

모모He pecks at her finger,

모모And pecks at her lips,And hovers and flutters,

모모And round her he skips.

모모Then hasten thou homeward,

모모In fashion to be;If thou hast the maiden,

모모She also hath thee.

모모1816.-----ROLLICKING HANS.

모모HALLO there! A glass!

모모Ha! the draught's truly sweet!If for drink go my shoes,

모모I shall still have my feet.

모모A maiden and wine,

모모With sweet music and song,--I would they were mine,

모모All life's journey along!

모모If I depart from this sad sphere,And leave a will behind me here,A suit at law will be preferr'd,But as for thanks,--the deuce a word!So ere I die, I squander all,And that a proper will I call.

모모HIS COMRADE.

모모Hallo there! A glass!

모모Ha! the draught's truly sweetIf thou keepest thy shoes,

모모Thou wilt then spare thy feet.

모모A maiden and wine,

모모With sweet music and song,On pavement, are thine,

모모All life's journey along!-----THE FREEBOOTER,

모모No door has my house,

모모No house has my door;And in and out ever

모모I carry my store.

모모No grate has my kitchen,

모모No kitchen my grate;Yet roasts it and boils it

모모Both early and late.

모모My bed has no trestles,

모모My trestles no bed;Yet merrier moments

모모No mortal e'er led.

모모My cellar is lofty,

모모My barn is full deep,From top to the bottom,--

모모There lie I and sleep.

모모And soon as I waken,

모모All moves on its race;My place has no fixture,

모모My fixture no place.

모모1827.*-----JOY AND SORROW.

모모As a fisher-boy I fared

모모To the black rock in the sea,And, while false gifts I prepared.

모모Listen'd and sang merrily,Down descended the decoy,

모모Soon a fish attack'd the bait;One exultant shout of joy,--

모모And the fish was captured straight.

모모Ah! on shore, and to the wood

모모Past the cliffs, o'er stock and stone,One foot's traces I pursued,

모모And the maiden was alone.Lips were silent, eyes downcast

모모As a clasp-knife snaps the bait,With her snare she seized me fast,

모모And the boy was captured straight.

모모Heav'n knows who's the happy swain

모모That she rambles with anew!I must dare the sea again,

모모Spite of wind and weather too.When the great and little fish

모모Wail and flounder in my net,Straight returns my eager wish

모모In her arms to revel yet!

모모1815.-----MARCH.

모모THE snow-flakes fall in showers,

모모The time is absent still,When all Spring's beauteous flowers,When all Spring's beauteous flowers

모모Our hearts with joy shall fill.

모모With lustre false and fleeting

모모The sun's bright rays are thrown;The swallow's self is cheating:The swallow's self is cheating,

모모And why? He comes alone!

모모Can I e'er feel delighted

모모Alone, though Spring is near?Yet when we are united,Yet when we are united,

모모The Summer will be here.

모모1817.-----APRIL.

모모TELL me, eyes, what 'tis ye're seeking;

모모For ye're saying something sweet,

모모Fit the ravish'd ear to greet,Eloquently, softly speaking.

모모Yet I see now why ye're roving;

모모For behind those eyes so bright,

모모To itself abandon'd quite,Lies a bosom, truthful, loving,--

모모One that it must fill with pleasure

모모'Mongst so many, dull and blind,

모모One true look at length to find,That its worth can rightly treasure.

모모Whilst I'm lost in studying ever

모모To explain these cyphers duly,--

모모To unravel my looks trulyIn return be your endeavour!

모모1820.-----MAY.

모모LIGHT and silv'ry cloudlets hover

모모In the air, as yet scarce warm;Mild, with glimmer soft tinged over,

모모Peeps the sun through fragrant balm.Gently rolls and heaves the ocean

모모As its waves the bank o'erflow.And with ever restless motion

모모Moves the verdure to and fro,

모모Mirror'd brightly far below.

모모What is now the foliage moving?

모모Air is still, and hush'd the breeze,Sultriness, this fullness loving,

모모Through the thicket, from the trees.Now the eye at once gleams brightly,

모모See! the infant band with mirthMoves and dances nimbly, lightly,

모모As the morning gave it birth,

모모Flutt'ring two and two o'er earth.

모모*      *      *      *

모모1816.-----JUNE.

모모SHE behind yon mountain lives,Who my love's sweet guerdon gives.Tell me, mount, how this can be!Very glass thou seem'st to me,And I seem to be close by,For I see her drawing nigh;Now, because I'm absent, sad,Now, because she sees me, glad!

모모Soon between us rise to sightValleys cool, with bushes light,Streams and meadows; next appear

모모Mills and wheels, the surest tokenThat a level spot is near,

모모Plains far-stretching and unbroken.And so onwards, onwards roam,To my garden and my home!

모모But how comes it then to pass?All this gives no joy, alas!--I was ravish'd by her sight,By her eyes so fair and bright,By her footstep soft and light.How her peerless charms I praised,When from head to foot I gazed!I am here, she's far away,--I am gone, with her to stay.

모모If on rugged hills she wander,

모모If she haste the vale along,Pinions seem to flutter yonder,

모모And the air is fill'd with song;With the glow of youth still playing,

모모Joyous vigour in each limb,One in silence is delaying,

모모She alone 'tis blesses him.

모모Love, thou art too fair, I ween!Fairer I have never seen!From the heart full easilyBlooming flowers are cull'd by thee.If I think: "Oh, were it so,"Bone and marrow seen to glow!If rewarded by her love,Can I greater rapture prove?

모모And still fairer is the bride,When in me she will confide,When she speaks and lets me knowAll her tale of joy and woe.All her lifetime's historyNow is fully known to me.Who in child or woman e'erSoul and body found so fair?

모모1815.-----NEXT YEAR'S SPRING.

모모THE bed of flowers

모모Loosens amain,The beauteous snowdrops

모모Droop o'er the plain.The crocus opens

모모Its glowing bud,Like emeralds others,

모모Others, like blood.With saucy gesture

모모Primroses flare,And roguish violets,

모모Hidden with care;And whatsoever

모모There stirs and strives,The Spring's contented,

모모If works and thrives.

모모'Mongst all the blossoms

모모That fairest are,My sweetheart's sweetness

모모Is sweetest far;Upon me ever

모모Her glances light,My song they waken,

모모My words make bright,An ever open

모모And blooming mind,In sport, unsullied,

모모In earnest, kind.Though roses and lilies

모모By Summer are brought,Against my sweetheart

모모Prevails he nought.

모모1816.-----AT MIDNIGHT HOUR.

모모[Goethe relates that a remarkable situation he was in one brightmoonlight night led to the composition of this sweet song, whichwas "the dearer to him because he could not say whence it cameand whither it would."]

모모AT midnight hour I went, not willingly,

모모A little, little boy, yon churchyard past,To Father Vicar's house; the stars on high

모모On all around their beauteous radiance cast,

모모At midnight hour.

모모And when, in journeying o'er the path of life,

모모My love I follow'd, as she onward moved,With stars and northern lights o'er head in strife,

모모Going and coming, perfect bliss I proved

모모At midnight hour.

모모Until at length the full moon, lustre-fraught,

모모Burst thro' the gloom wherein she was enshrined;And then the willing, active, rapid thought

모모Around the past, as round the future twined,

모모At midnight hour.

모모1818.-----TO THE RISING FULL MOON.

모모Dornburg, 25th August, 1828.

모모WILT thou suddenly enshroud thee,

모모Who this moment wert so nigh?Heavy rising masses cloud thee,

모모Thou art hidden from mine eye.

모모Yet my sadness thou well knowest,

모모Gleaming sweetly as a star!That I'm loved, 'tis thou that showest,

모모Though my loved one may be far.

모모Upward mount then! clearer, milder,

모모Robed in splendour far more bright!Though my heart with grief throbs wilder,

모모Fraught with rapture is the night!

모모1828.-----THE BRIDEGROOM.*

모모(Not in the English sense of the word, but the German, where ithas the meaning of betrothed.)

모모I SLEPT,--'twas midnight,--in my bosom woke,

모모As though 'twere day, my love-o'erflowing heart;To me it seemed like night, when day first broke;

모모What is't to me, whate'er it may impart?

모모She was away; the world's unceasing strife

모모For her alone I suffer'd through the heatOf sultry day; oh, what refreshing life

모모At cooling eve!--my guerdon was complete.

모모The sun now set, and wand'ring hand in hand,

모모His last and blissful look we greeted then;While spake our eyes, as they each other scann'd:

모모"From the far east, let's trust, he'll come again!"

모모At midnight!--the bright stars, in vision blest,

모모Guide to the threshold where she slumbers calm:Oh be it mine, there too at length to rest,--

모모Yet howsoe'er this prove, life's full of charm!

모모1828.-----SUCH, SUCH IS HE WHO PLEASETH ME.

모모FLY, dearest, fly! He is not nigh!

모모He who found thee one fair morn in Spring

모모In the wood where thou thy flight didst wing.Fly, dearest, fly! He is not nigh!Never rests the foot of evil spy.

모모Hark! flutes' sweet strains and love's refrains

모모Reach the loved one, borne there by the wind,

모모In the soft heart open doors they find.Hark! flutes' sweet strains and love's refrains,Hark!--yet blissful love their echo pains.

모모Erect his head, and firm his tread,

모모Raven hair around his smooth brow strays,

모모On his cheeks a Spring eternal plays.Erect his head, and firm his tread,And by grace his ev'ry step is led.

모모Happy his breast, with pureness bless'd,

모모And the dark eyes 'neath his eyebrows placed,

모모With full many a beauteous line are graced.Happy his breast, with pureness bless'd,Soon as seen, thy love must be confess'd.

모모His mouth is red--its power I dread,

모모On his lips morn's fragrant incense lies,

모모Round his lips the cooling Zephyr sighs.His mouth is red--its power I dread,With one glance from him, all sorrow's fled.

모모His blood is true, his heart bold too,

모모In his soft arms, strength, protection, dwells

모모And his face with noble pity swells.His blood is true, his heart bold too,Blest the one whom those dear arms may woo!

모모1816..-----SICILIAN SONG.

모모YE black and roguish eyes,

모모If ye command.Each house in ruins lies,

모모No town can stand.And shall my bosom's chain,--

모모This plaster wall,?To think one moment, deign,--

모모Shall ii not fall?

모모1811.-----SWISS SONG,

모모Up in th' mountainI was a-sitting,With the bird thereAs my guest,Blithely singing,Blithely springing,And buildingHis nest.

모모In the gardenI was a-standing,And the bee thereSaw as well,Buzzing, humming,Going, coming,And buildingHis cell.

모모O'er the meadowI was a-going,And there saw theButterflies,Sipping, dancing,Flying, glancing,And charmingThe eyes.

모모And then came myDear Hansel,And I show'd themWith glee,Sipping, quaffing,And he, laughing,Sweet kissesGave me.

모모1811.-----FINNISH SONG.

모모IF the loved one, the well-known one,Should return as he departed,On his lips would ring my kisses,Though the wolf's blood might have dyed them;And a hearty grasp I'd give him,Though his finger-ends were serpents.

모모Wind! Oh, if thou hadst but reason,Word for word in turns thou'dst carry,E'en though some perchance might perish'Tween two lovers so far distant.

모모All choice morsels I'd dispense with,Table-flesh of priests neglect too,Sooner than renounce my lover,Whom, in Summer having vanquish'd,I in Winter tamed still longer.

모모1810.-----GIPSY SONG.

모모IN the drizzling mist, with the snow high-pil'd,In the Winter night, in the forest wild,I heard the wolves with their ravenous howl,I heard the screaming note of the owl:

모모Wille wau wau wau!

모모Wille wo wo wo!

모모Wito hu!

모모I shot, one day, a cat in a ditch--The dear black cat of Anna the witch;Upon me, at night, seven were-wolves came down,Seven women they were, from out of the town.

모모Wille wau wau wau!

모모Wille wo wo wo!

모모Wito hu!

모모I knew them all; ay, I knew them straight;First, Anna, then Ursula, Eve, and Kate,And Barbara, Lizzy, and Bet as well;And forming a ring, they began to yell:

모모Wille wau wau wau!

모모Wille wo wo wo!

모모Wito hu!

모모Then call'd I their names with angry threat:"What wouldst thou, Anna? What wouldst thou, Bet?"At hearing my voice, themselves they shook,And howling and yelling, to flight they took.

모모Wille wau wau wau!

모모Wille wo wo wo!

모모Wito hu!

모모1772.-----THE DESTRUCTION OF MAGDEBURG.

모모[For a fine account of the fearful sack of Magdeburg, by Tilly,in the year 1613, see SCHILLER's History of the Thirty Years'War.]

모모OH, Magdeberg the town!Fair maids thy beauty crown,Thy charms fair maids and matrons crown;Oh, Magdeburg the town!

모모Where all so blooming stands,Advance fierce Tilly's bands;O'er gardens and o'er well--till'd landsAdvance fierce Tilly's bands.

모모Now Tilly's at the gate.Our homes who'll liberate?Go, loved one, hasten to the gate,And dare the combat straight!

모모There is no need as yet,However fierce his threat;Thy rosy cheeks I'll kiss, sweet pet!There is no need as yet.

모모My longing makes me pale.Oh, what can wealth avail?E'en now thy father may be pale.Thou mak'st my courage fail.

모모Oh, mother, give me bread!Is then my father dead?Oh, mother, one small crust of bread!Oh, what misfortune dread!

모모Thy father, dead lies he,The trembling townsmen flee,Adown the street the blood runs free;Oh, whither shall we flee?

모모The churches ruined lie,The houses burn on high,The roofs they smoke, the flames out fly,Into the street then hie!

모모No safety there they meet!The soldiers fill the Street,With fire and sword the wreck complete:No safety there they meet!

모모Down falls the houses' line,Where now is thine or mine?That bundle yonder is not thine,Thou flying maiden mine!

모모The women sorrow sore.The maidens far, far more.The living are no virgins more;Thus Tilly's troops make war!-----

모모FAMILIAR SONGS.

모모------What we sing in companySoon from heart to heart will fly.-----

모모THE Gesellige Lieder, which I have angicisled as above, asseveral of them cannot be called convivial songs, are separatedby Goethe from his other songs, and I have adhered to the samearrangement. The Ergo bibamus is a well-known drinking song inGermany, where it enjoys vast popularity.

모모ON THE NEW YEAR.

모모[Composed for a merry party that used to meet, in 1802, atGoethe's house.]

모모FATE now allows us,

모모'Twixt the departing

모모And the upstarting,Happy to be;And at the call of

모모Memory cherish'd,

모모Future and perish'dMoments we see.

모모Seasons of anguish,--

모모Ah, they must ever

모모Truth from woe sever,Love and joy part;Days still more worthy

모모Soon will unite us,

모모Fairer songs light us,Strength'ning the heart.

모모We, thus united,

모모Think of, with gladness,

모모Rapture and sadness,Sorrow now flies.Oh, how mysterious

모모Fortune's direction!

모모Old the connection,

모모New-born the prize!

모모Thank, for this, Fortune,

모모Wavering blindly!

모모Thank all that kindlyFate may bestow!Revel in change's

모모Impulses clearer,

모모Love far sincerer,More heartfelt glow!

모모Over the old one,

모모Wrinkles collected,

모모Sad and dejected,Others may view;But, on us gently

모모Shineth a true one,

모모And to the new oneWe, too, are new.

모모As a fond couple

모모'Midst the dance veering,

모모First disappearing,Then reappear,So let affection

모모Guide thro' life's mazy

모모Pathways so hazyInto the year!

모모1802.-----ANNIVERSARY SONG.

모모[This little song describes the different members of the partyjust spoken of.]

모모WHY pacest thou, my neighbour fair,

모모The garden all alone?If house and land thou seek'st to guard,

모모I'd thee as mistress own.

모모My brother sought the cellar-maid,

모모And suffered her no rest;She gave him a refreshing draught,

모모A kiss, too, she impress'd.

모모My cousin is a prudent wight,

모모The cook's by him ador'd;He turns the spit round ceaselessly,

모모To gain love's sweet reward.

모모We six together then began

모모A banquet to consume,When lo! a fourth pair singing came,

모모And danced into the room.

모모Welcome were they,--and welcome too

모모Was a fifth jovial pair.Brimful of news, and stored with tales

모모And jests both new and rare.

모모For riddles, spirit, raillery,

모모And wit, a place remain'd;A sixth pair then our circle join'd,

모모And so that prize was gain'd.

모모And yet to make us truly blest,

모모One miss'd we, and full sore;A true and tender couple came,--

모모We needed them no more.

모모The social banquet now goes on,

모모Unchequer'd by alloy;The sacred double-numbers then

모모Let us at once enjoy!

모모1802.-----THE SPRING ORACLE.

모모OH prophetic bird so bright,Blossom-songster, cuckoo bight!In the fairest time of year,Dearest bird, oh! deign to hearWhat a youthful pair would pray,Do thou call, if hope they may:Thy cuck-oo, thy cuck-oo.Ever more cuck-oo, cuck-oo!

모모Hearest thou? A loving pairFain would to the altar fare;Yes! a pair in happy youth,Full of virtue, full of truth.Is the hour not fix'd by fate?Say, how long must they still wait?Hark! cuck-oo! hark! cuck-oo!Silent yet! for shame, cuck-oo!

모모'Tis not our fault, certainly!Only two years patient be!But if we ourselves please here,Will pa-pa-papas appear?Know that thou'lt more kindness do us,More thou'lt prophesy unto us.One! cuck-oo! Two! cuck-oo!Ever, ever, cuck-oo, cuck-oo, coo!

모모If we've calculated clearly,We have half a dozen nearly.If good promises we'll give,Wilt thou say how long we'II live?Truly, we'll confess to thee,We'd prolong it willingly.Coo cuck-oo, coo cuck-oo,Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo!

모모Life is one continued feast--(If we keep no score, at least).If now we together dwell,Will true love remain as well?For if that should e'er decay,Happiness would pass away.Coo cuck-oo, coo cuck-oo,Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo!

모모1803.*(Gracefully in infinitum.)-----THE HAPPY COUPLE.

모모AFTER these vernal rains

모모That we so warmly sought,Dear wife, see how our plains

모모With blessings sweet are fraught!We cast our distant gaze

모모Far in the misty blue;Here gentle love still strays,

모모Here dwells still rapture true.

모모Thou seest whither go

모모Yon pair of pigeons white,Where swelling violets blow

모모Round sunny foliage bright.'Twas there we gather'd first

모모A nosegay as we roved;There into flame first burst

모모The passion that we proved.

모모Yet when, with plighted troth,

모모The priest beheld us fareHome from the altar both,

모모With many a youthful pair,--Then other moons had birth,

모모And many a beauteous sun,Then we had gain'd the earth

모모Whereon life's race to run.

모모A hundred thousand fold

모모The mighty bond was seal'd;In woods, on mountains cold,

모모In bushes, in the field,Within the wall, in caves,

모모And on the craggy height,And love, e'en o'er the waves,

모모Bore in his tube the light.

모모Contented we remain'd,

모모We deem'd ourselves a pair;'Twas otherwise ordain'd,

모모For, lo! a third was there;A fourth, fifth, sixth appear'd,

모모And sat around our board;And now the plants we've rear'd

모모High o'er our heads have soar'd!

모모How fair and pleasant looks,

모모On yonder beauteous spot,Embraced by poplar-brooks,

모모The newly-finish'd cot!Who is it there that sits

모모In that glad home above?Is't not our darling Fritz

모모With his own darling love?

모모Beside yon precipice,

모모Whence pent-up waters steal,And leaving the abyss,

모모Fall foaming through the wheel,Though people often tell

모모Of millers' wives so fair,Yet none can e'er excel

모모Our dearest daughter there!

모모Yet where the thick-set green

모모Stands round yon church and sad,Where the old fir-tree's seen

모모Alone tow'rd heaven to nod,--'Tis there the ashes lie

모모Of our untimely dead;From earth our gaze on high

모모By their blest memory's led.

모모See how yon hill is bright

모모With billowy-waving arms!The force returns, whose might

모모Has vanquished war's alarms.Who proudly hastens here

모모With wreath-encircled brow?'Tis like our child so dear

모모Thus Charles comes homeward now.

모모That dearest honour'd guest

모모Is welcom'd by the bride;She makes the true one blest,

모모At the glad festal tide.And ev'ry one makes haste

모모To join the dance with glee;While thou with wreaths hast graced

모모The youngest children three.

모모To sound of flute and horn

모모The time appears renew'd,When we, in love's young morn,

모모In the glad dance upstood;And perfect bliss I know

모모Ere the year's course is run,For to the font we go

모모With grandson and with son!

모모1803.*-----SONG OF FELLOWSHIP.

모모[Written and sung in honour of the birthday of the Pastor Ewaldat the time of Goethe's happy connection with Lily.]

모모IN ev'ry hour of joy

모모That love and wine prolong,The moments we'll employ

모모To carol forth this song!We're gathered in His name,

모모Whose power hath brought us here;He kindled first our flame,

모모He bids it burn more clear.

모모Then gladly glow to-night,

모모And let our hearts combine!Up! quaff with fresh delight

모모This glass of sparkling wine!Up! hail the joyous hour,

모모And let your kiss be true;With each new bond of power

모모The old becomes the new!

모모Who in our circle lives,

모모And is not happy there?True liberty it gives,

모모And brother's love so fair.Thus heart and heart through life

모모With mutual love are fill'd;And by no causeless strife

모모Our union e'er is chill'd.

모모Our hopes a God has crown'd

모모With life-discernment free,And all we view around,

모모Renews our ecstasy.Ne'er by caprice oppress'd,

모모Our bliss is ne'er destroy'd;More freely throbs our breast,

모모By fancies ne'er alloy'd.

모모Where'er our foot we set,

모모The more life's path extends,And brighter, brighter yet

모모Our gaze on high ascends.We know no grief or pain,

모모Though all things fall and rise;Long may we thus remain!

모모Eternal be our ties!

모모1775.-----CONSTANCY IN CHANGE.

모모COULD this early bliss but rest

모모Constant for one single hour!But e'en now the humid West

모모Scatters many a vernal shower.Should the verdure give me joy?

모모'Tis to it I owe the shade;Soon will storms its bloom destroy,

모모Soon will Autumn bid it fade.

모모Eagerly thy portion seize,

모모If thou wouldst possess the fruit!Fast begin to ripen these,

모모And the rest already shoot.With each heavy storm of rain

모모Change comes o'er thy valley fair;Once, alas! but not again

모모Can the same stream hold thee e'er.

모모And thyself, what erst at least

모모Firm as rocks appear'd to rise,Walls and palaces thou seest

모모But with ever-changing eyes.Fled for ever now the lip

모모That with kisses used to glow,And the foot, that used to skip

모모O'er the mountain, like the roe.

모모And the hand, so true and warm,

모모Ever raised in charity,And the cunning-fashion'd form,--

모모All are now changed utterly.And what used to bear thy name,

모모When upon yon spot it stood,Like a rolling billow came,

모모Hast'ning on to join the flood.

모모Be then the beginning found

모모With the end in unison,Swifter than the forms around

모모Are themselves now fleeting on!Thank the merit in thy breast,

모모Thank the mould within thy heart,That the Muses' favour blestNe'er will perish, ne'er depart.

모모1803.*-----TABLE SONG.

모모[Composed for the merry party already mentioned, on the occasionof the departure for France of the hereditary prince, who was oneof the number, and who is especially alluded to in the 3rdverse.]

모모O'ER me--how I cannot say,--

모모Heav'nly rapture's growing.Will it help to guide my way

모모To yon stars all-glowing?Yet that here I'd sooner be,

모모To assert I'm able,Where, with wine and harmony,

모모I may thump the table.

모모Wonder not, my dearest friends,

모모What 'tis gives me pleasure;For of all that earth e'er lends,

모모'Tis the sweetest treasure.Therefore solemnly I swear,

모모With no reservation,That maliciously I'll ne'er

모모Leave my present station.

모모Now that here we're gather'd round,

모모Chasing cares and slumbers,Let, methought, the goblet sound

모모To the bard's glad numbers!Many a hundred mile away,

모모Go those we love dearly;Therefore let us here to-day

모모Make the glass ring clearly!

모모Here's His health, through Whom we live!

모모I that faith inherit.To our king the next toast give,

모모Honour is his merit,'Gainst each in-- and outward foe

모모He's our rock and tower.Of his maintenance thinks he though,

모모More that grows his power.

모모Next to her good health I drink,

모모Who has stirr'd my passion;Of his mistress let each think,

모모Think in knightly fashion.If the beauteous maid but see

모모Whom 'tis I now call so,Let her smiling nod to me:

모모"Here's my love's health also!"

모모To those friends,--the two or three,--

모모Be our next toast given,In whose presence revel we,

모모In the silent even,--Who the gloomy mist so cold

모모Scatter gently, lightly;To those friends, then, new or old,

모모Let the toast ring brightly.

모모Broader now the stream rolls on,

모모With its waves more swelling,While in higher, nobler tone,

모모Comrades, we are dwelling,--We who with collected might,

모모Bravely cling together,Both in fortune's sunshine bright,

모모And in stormy weather.

모모Just as we are gather'd thus,

모모Others are collected;On them, therefore, as on us,

모모Be Fate's smile directed!From the springhead to the sea,

모모Many a mill's revolving,And the world's prosperity

모모Is the task I'm solving.

모모1802.-----WONT AND DONE.

모모I HAVE loved; for the first time with passion I rave!I then was the servant, but now am the slave;

모모I then was the servant of all:By this creature so charming I now am fast bound,To love and love's guerdon she turns all around,

모모And her my sole mistress I call.

모모l've had faith; for the first time my faith is now strong!And though matters go strangely, though matters go wrong,

모모To the ranks of the faithful I'm true:Though ofttimes 'twas dark and though ofttimes 'twas drear,In the pressure of need, and when danger was near,

모모Yet the dawning of light I now view.

모모I have eaten; but ne'er have thus relish'd my food!For when glad are the senses, and joyous the blood,

모모At table all else is effacedAs for youth, it but swallows, then whistles an air;As for me, to a jovial resort I'd repair,

모모Where to eat, and enjoy what I taste.

모모I have drunk; but have never thus relish'd the bowl!For wine makes us lords, and enlivens the soul,

모모And loosens the trembling slave's tongue.Let's not seek to spare then the heart-stirring drink,For though in the barrel the old wine may sink,

모모In its place will fast mellow the young.

모모I have danced, and to dancing am pledged by a vow!Though no caper or waltz may be raved about now,

모모In a dance that's becoming, whirl round.And he who a nosegay of flowers has dress'd,And cares not for one any more than the rest,

모모With a garland of mirth is aye crown'd.

모모Then once more be merry, and banish all woes!For he who but gathers the blossoming rose.

모모By its thorns will be tickled alone.To-day still, as yesterday, glimmers the star;Take care from all heads that hang down to keep far,

모모And make but the future thine own.

모모1813.-----GENERAL CONFESSION.

모모In this noble ring to-day

모모Let my warning shame ye!Listen to my solemn voice,--

모모Seldom does it name ye.Many a thing have ye intended,

모모Many a thing have badly ended,And now I must blame ye.

모모At some moment in our lives

모모We must all repent us!So confess, with pious trust,

모모All your sins momentous!Error's crooked pathways shunning.

모모Let us, on the straight road running,Honestly content us!

모모Yes! we've oft, when waking, dream'd,

모모Let's confess it rightly;Left undrain'd the brimming cup,

모모When it sparkled brightly;Many a shepherd's-hour's soft blisses,

모모Many a dear mouth's flying kissesWe've neglected lightly.

모모Mute and silent have we sat,

모모Whilst the blockheads prated,And above e'en song divine

모모Have their babblings rated;To account we've even call'd us

모모For the moments that enthrall'd us,With enjoyment freighted.

모모If thou'lt absolution grant

모모To thy true ones ever,We, to execute thy will,

모모Ceaseless will endeavour,From half-measures strive to wean us,

모모Wholly, fairly, well demean us,Resting, flagging never.

모모At all blockheads we'll at once

모모Let our laugh ring clearly,And the pearly-foaming wine

모모Never sip at merely.Ne'er with eye alone give kisses,

모모But with boldness suck in blissesFrom those lips loved dearly.

모모1803.*-----COPTIC SONG.

모모LEAVE we the pedants to quarrel and strive,

모모Rigid and cautious the teachers to be!All of the wisest men e'er seen alive

모모Smile, nod, and join in the chorus with me:"Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--

모모Children of wisdom,--remember the word!"

모모Merlin the old, from his glittering grave,When I, a stripling, once spoke to him,--gave

모모Just the same answer as that I've preferr'd;"Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--

모모Children of wisdom,--remember the word!"

모모And on the Indian breeze as it booms,And in the depths of Egyptian tombs,

모모Only the same holy saying I've heard:"Vain 'tis to wait till the dolt grows less silly!Play then the fool with the fool, willy-nilly,--

모모Children of wisdom,--remember the word!"

모모1789.*-----ANOTHER.

모모Go! obedient to my call,

모모Turn to profit thy young days,

모모Wiser make betimes thy breast

모모In Fate's balance as it sways,

모모Seldom is the cock at rest;Thou must either mount, or fall,

모모Thou must either rule and win,

모모Or submissively give in,Triumph, or else yield to clamour:Be the anvil or the hammer.

모모1789.-----VANITAS! VANITATUM VANITAS!

모모MY trust in nothing now is placed,

모모Hurrah!So in the world true joy I taste,

모모Hurrah!Then he who would be a comrade of mineMust rattle his glass, and in chorus combine,Over these dregs of wine.

모모I placed my trust in gold and wealth,

모모Hurrah!But then I lost all joy and health,

모모Lack-a-day!Both here and there the money roll'd,And when I had it here, behold,From there had fled the gold!

모모I placed my trust in women next,

모모Hurrah!But there in truth was sorely vex'd,

모모Lack-a-day!The False another portion sought,The True with tediousness were fraught,The Best could not be bought.

모모My trust in travels then I placed,

모모Hurrah!And left my native land in haste.

모모Lack-a-day!But not a single thing seem'd good,The beds were bad, and strange the food,And I not understood.

모모I placed my trust in rank and fame,

모모Hurrah!Another put me straight to shame,

모모Lack-a-day!And as I had been prominent,All scowl'd upon me as I went,I found not one content.

모모I placed my trust in war and fight,

모모Hurrah!We gain'd full many a triumph bright,

모모Hurrah!Into the foeman's land we cross'd,We put our friends to equal cost,And there a leg I lost.

모모My trust is placed in nothing now,

모모Hurrah!At my command the world must bow,

모모Hurrah!And as we've ended feast and strain,The cup we'll to the bottom drain;No dregs must there remain!

모모1806.-----FORTUNE OF WAR.

모모NOUGHT more accursed in war I know

모모Than getting off scot-free;Inured to danger, on we go

모모In constant victory;We first unpack, then pack again,

모모With only this reward,That when we're marching, we complain,

모모And when in camp, are bor'd.

모모The time for billeting comes next,--

모모The peasant curses it;Each nobleman is sorely vex'd,

모모'Tis hated by the cit.Be civil, bad though be thy food,

모모The clowns politely treat;If to our hosts we're ever rude,

모모Jail-bread we're forced to eat.

모모And when the cannons growl around,

모모And small arms rattle clear,And trumpet, trot, and drum resound,

모모We merry all appear;And as it in the fight may chance,

모모We yield, then charge amain,And now retire, and now advance,

모모And yet a cross ne'er gain.

모모At length there comes a musket-ball,

모모And hits the leg, please Heaven;And then our troubles vanish all,

모모For to the town we're driven,(Well cover'd by the victor's force,)

모모Where we in wrath first came,--The women, frightened then, of course,

모모Are loving now and tame.

모모Cellar and heart are open'd wide,

모모The cook's allow'd no rest;While beds with softest down supplied

모모Are by our members press'd.The nimble lads upon us wait,

모모No sleep the hostess takesHer shift is torn in pieces straight,--

모모What wondrous lint it makes!

모모If one has tended carefully

모모The hero's wounded limb,Her neighbour cannot rest, for she

모모Has also tended him.A third arrives in equal haste,

모모At length they all are there,And in the middle he is placed

모모Of the whole band so fair!

모모On good authority the king

모모Hears how we love the fight,And bids them cross and ribbon bring,

모모Our coat and breast to dight.Say if a better fate can e'er

모모A son of Mars pursue!'Midst tears at length we go from there,

모모Beloved and honour'd too.

모모1814.-----OPEN TABLE.

모모MANY a guest I'd see to-day,

모모Met to taste my dishes!Food in plenty is prepar'd,

모모Birds, and game, and fishes.Invitations all have had,

모모All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

모모Are they hither wending?

모모Pretty girls I hope to see,

모모Dear and guileless misses,Ignorant how sweet it is

모모Giving tender kisses.Invitations all have had,

모모All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

모모Are they hither wending?

모모Women also I expect,

모모Loving tow'rd their spouses,Whose rude grumbling in their breasts

모모Greater love but rouses.Invitations they've had too,

모모All proposed attending!Johnny, go and look around!

모모Are they hither wending?

모모I've too ask'd young gentlemen,

모모Who are far from haughty,And whose purses are well-stock'd,

모모Well-behaved, not haughty.These especially I ask'd,

모모All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

모모Are they hither wending?

모모Men I summon'd with respect,

모모Who their own wives treasure;Who in ogling other Fair

모모Never take a pleasure.To my greetings they replied,

모모All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

모모Are they hither wending?

모모Then to make our joy complete,

모모Poets I invited,Who love other's songs far more

모모Than what they've indited.All acceded to my wish,

모모All proposed attending.Johnny, go and look around!

모모Are they hither wending?

모모Not a single one appears,

모모None seem this way posting.All the soup boils fast away,

모모Joints are over-roasting.Ah, I fear that we have been

모모Rather too unbending!Johnny, tell me what you think!

모모None are hither wending.

모모Johnny, run and quickly bring

모모Other guests to me now!Each arriving as he is--

모모That's the plan, I see now.In the town at once 'tis known,

모모Every one's commending.Johnny, open all the doors:

모모All are hither wending!

모모1815.*-----THE RECKONING.

모모LEADER.

모모LET no cares now hover o'er us

모모Let the wine unsparing run!Wilt thou swell our merry chorus?

모모Hast thou all thy duty done?

모모SOLO.

모모Two young folks--the thing is curious--

모모Loved each other; yesterdayBoth quite mild, to-day quite furious,

모모Next day, quite the deuce to pay!If her neck she there was stooping,

모모He must here needs pull his hair.I revived their spirits drooping,

모모And they're now a happy pair.

모모CHORUS.

모모Surely we for wine may languish!

모모Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

모모Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

모모SOLO.

모모Why, young orphan, all this wailing?

모모"Would to heaven that I were dead!For my guardian's craft prevailing

모모Soon will make me beg my bread."Knowing well the rascal genus,

모모Into court I dragg'd the knave;Fair the judges were between us,

모모And the maiden's wealth did save.

모모CHORUS.

모모Surely we for wine may languish!

모모Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

모모Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

모모SOLO.

모모To a little fellow, quiet,

모모Unpretending and subdued,Has a big clown, running riot,

모모Been to-day extremely rude.I bethought me of my duty,

모모And my courage swell'd apace,So I spoil'd the rascal's beauty,

모모Slashing him across the face.

모모CHORUS.

모모Surely we for wine may languish!

모모Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

모모Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

모모SOLO.

모모Brief must be my explanation,

모모For I really have done nought.Free from trouble and vexation,

모모I a landlord's business bought.There I've done, with all due ardour,

모모All that duty order'd me;Each one ask'd me for the larder,

모모And there was no scarcity.

모모CHORUS.

모모Surely we for wine may languish!

모모Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

모모Thou to-day in joy hast drown'd.

모모LEADER.

모모Each should thus make proclamation

모모Of what he did well to-day!That's the match whose conflagration

모모Should inflame our tuneful lay.Let it be our precept ever

모모To admit no waverer here!For to act the good endeavour,

모모None but rascals meek appear.

모모CHORUS.

모모Surely we for wine may languish!

모모Let the bumper then go round!For all sighs and groans of anguish

모모We have now in rapture drown'd.

모모TRIO.

모모Let each merry minstrel enter,

모모He's right welcome to our hall!'Tis but with the self캆ormentor

모모That we are not liberal;

모모For we fear that his caprices,

모모That his eye-brows dark and sad,That his grief that never ceases

모모Hide an empty heart, or bad.

모모CHORUS.

모모No one now for wine shall languish!

모모Here no minstrel shall be found,Who all sighs and groans of anguish,

모모Has not first in rapture drown'd!

모모1810.-----ERGO BIBAMUS!

모모FOR a praiseworthy object we're now gather'd here,

모모So, brethren, sing: ERGO BIBAMUS!Tho' talk may be hush'd, yet the glasses ring clear,

모모Remember then: ERGO BIBAMUS!In truth 'tis an old, 'tis an excellent word,With its sound so befitting each bosom is stirr'd,And an echo the festal hall filling is heard,

모모A glorious ERGO BIBAMUS!

모모I saw mine own love in her beauty so rare,

모모And bethought me of: ERGO BIBAMUS;So I gently approach'd, and she let me stand there,

모모While I help'd myself, thinking: BIBAMUS!And when she's appeased, and will clasp you and kiss,Or when those embraces and kisses ye miss,Take refuge, till sound is some worthier bliss,

모모In the comforting ERGO BIBAMUS!

모모I am call'd by my fate far away from each friend;

모모Ye loved ones, then: ERGO BIBAMUS!With wallet light-laden from hence I must wend.

모모So double our ERGO BIBAMUS!Whate'er to his treasures the niggard may add,Yet regard for the joyous will ever be had,For gladness lends over its charms to the glad,

모모So, brethren, sing; ERGO BIBAMUS!

모모And what shall we say of to-day as it flies?

모모I thought but of: ERGO BIBAMUS'Tis one of those truly that seldom arise,

모모So again and again sing: BIBAMUS!For joy through a wide-open portal it guides,Bright glitter the clouds, as the curtain divides,An a form, a divine one, to greet us in glides,

모모While we thunder our: ERGO BIBAMUS!

모모1810.-----EPIPHANIAS.

모모THE three holy kings with their star's bright ray,--They eat and they drink, but had rather not pay;They like to eat and drink away,They eat and drink, but had rather not pay.

모모The three holy kings have all come here,In number not four, but three they appear;And if a fourth join'd the other three,Increased by one their number would be.

모모The first am I,--the fair and the white,I ought to be seen when the sun shines bright!But, alas! with all my spices and myrrh,No girl now likes me,--I please not her.

모모The next am I,--the brown and the long,Known well to women, known well to song.Instead of spices, 'tis gold I bear,And so I'm welcome everywhere.

모모The last am I,--the black and small,And fain would be right merry withal.I like to eat and to drink full measure,I eat and drink, and give thanks with pleasure.

모모The three holy kings are friendly and mild,They seek the Mother, and seek the Child;The pious Joseph is sitting by,The ox and the ass on their litter lie.

모모We're bringing gold, we're bringing myrrh,The women incense always prefer;And if we have wine of a worthy growth,We three to drink like six are not loth.

모모As here we see fair lads and lasses,But not a sign of oxen or asses,We know that we have gone astrayAnd so go further on our way.-----

모모BALLADS.

모모-----Poet's art is ever ableTo endow with truth mere fable.----MIGNON.[This universally known poem is also to be found in WilhelmMeister.]

모모KNOW'ST thou the land where the fair citron blows,Where the bright orange midst the foliage glows,Where soft winds greet us from the azure skies,Where silent myrtles, stately laurels rise,Know'st thou it well?

모모'Tis there, 'tis there,That I with thee, beloved one, would repair.

모모Know'st thou the house? On columns rests its pile,Its halls are gleaming, and its chambers smile,And marble statues stand and gaze on me:"Poor child! what sorrow hath befallen thee?"Know'st thou it well?

모모'Tis there, 'tis there,That I with thee, protector, would repair!

모모Know'st thou the mountain, and its cloudy bridge?The mule can scarcely find the misty ridge;In caverns dwells the dragon's olden brood,The frowning crag obstructs the raging flood.Know'st thou it well?

모모'Tis there, 'tis there,Our path lies--Father--thither, oh repair!

모모1795.*-----THE MINSTREL.

모모[This fine poem is introduced in the second book of WilhelmMeister.]

모모"WHAT tuneful strains salute mine ear

모모Without the castle walls?Oh, let the song re-echo here,

모모Within our festal halls!"Thus spake the king, the page out-hied;The boy return'd; the monarch cried:

모모"Admit the old man yonder!"

모모"All hail, ye noble lords to-night!

모모All hail, ye beauteous dames!Star placed by star! What heavenly sight!

모모Whoe'er can tell their names?Within this glittering hall sublime,Be closed, mine eyes! 'tis not the time

모모For me to feast my wonder."

모모The minstrel straightway closed his eyes,

모모And woke a thrilling tone;The knights look'd on in knightly guise,

모모Fair looks tow'rd earth were thrown.The monarch, ravish'd by the strain,Bade them bring forth a golden chain,

모모To be his numbers' guerdon.

모모"The golden chain give not to me,

모모But give the chain to thoseIn whose bold face we shiver'd see

모모The lances of our foes.Or give it to thy chancellor there;With other burdens he may bear

모모This one more golden burden.

모모"I sing, like birds of blithesome note,

모모That in the branches dwell;The song that rises from the throat

모모Repays the minstrel well.One boon I'd crave, if not too bold--One bumper in a cup of gold

모모Be as my guerdon given."

모모The bowl he raised, the bowl he quaff'd:

모모"Oh drink, with solace fraught!Oh, house thrice-blest, where such a draught

모모A trifling gift is thought!When Fortune smiles, remember me,And as I thank you heartily,

모모As warmly thank ye Heaven!"

모모1795.*-----BALLAD

모모OF THE BANISHED AND RETURNING COUNT.

모모[Goethe began to write an opera called Lowenstuhl, founded uponthe old tradition which forms the subject of this Ballad, but henever carried out his design.]

모모OH, enter old minstrel, thou time-honour'd one!We children are here in the hall all alone,

모모The portals we straightway will bar.Our mother is praying, our father is gone

모모To the forest, on wolves to make war.Oh sing us a ballad, the tale then repeat,

모모'Till brother and I learn it right;We long have been hoping a minstrel to meet,

모모For children hear tales with delight.

모모"At midnight, when darkness its fearful veil weaves,His lofty and stately old castle he leaves,

모모But first he has buried his wealth.What figure is that in his arms one perceives,

모모As the Count quits the gateway by stealth?O'er what is his mantle so hastily thrown?

모모What bears he along in his flight?A daughter it is, and she gently sleeps on"--

모모The children they hear with delight.

모모"The morning soon glimmers. the world is so wide,In valleys and forests a home is supplied,

모모The bard in each village is cheer'd.Thus lives he and wanders, while years onward glide,

모모And longer still waxes his beard;But the maiden so fair in his arms grows amain,

모모'Neath her star all-protecting and bright,Secured in the mantle from wind and from rain--"

모모The children they hear with delight.

모모"And year upon year with swift footstep now steals,The mantle it fades, many rents it reveals,

모모The maiden no more it can hold.The father he sees her, what rapture he feels!

모모His joy cannot now be controll'd.How worthy she seems of the race whence she springs,

모모How noble and fair to the sight!What wealth to her dearly-loved father she brings!"--

모모The children they hear with delight.

모모"Then comes there a princely knight galloping by,She stretches her hand out, as soon as he's nigh,

모모But alms he refuses to give.He seizes her hand, with a smile in his eye:

모모'Thou art mine!' he exclaims, 'while I live!''When thou know'st,' cries the old man, 'the treasure that'sthere,

모모A princess thou'lt make her of right;Betroth'd be she now, on this spot green and fair--'"

모모The children they hear with delight.

모모"So she's bless'd by the priest on the hallowed place,And she goes with a smiling but sorrowful face,

모모From her father she fain would not part.The old man still wanders with ne'er-changing pace,

모모He covers with joy his sad heart.So I think of my daughter, as years pass away,

모모And my grandchildren far from my sight;I bless them by night, and I bless them by day"--

모모The children they hear with delight.

모모He blesses the children: a knocking they hear,The father it is! They spring forward in fear,

모모The old man they cannot conceal--"Thou beggar, wouldst lure, then, my children so dear?

모모Straight seize him, ye vassals of steel!To the dungeon most deep, with the fool-hardy knave!"

모모The mother from far hears the fight;She hastens with flatt'ring entreaty to crave--

모모The children they hear with delight.

모모The vassals they suffer the Bard to stand there,And mother and children implore him to spare,

모모The proud prince would stifle his ire,'Till driven to fury at hearing their prayer,

모모His smouldering anger takes fire:"Thou pitiful race! Oh, thou beggarly crew!

모모Eclipsing my star, once so bright!Ye'll bring me destruction, ye sorely shall rue!"

모모The children they hear with affright.

모모The old man still stands there with dignified mien,The vassals of steel quake before him, I ween,

모모The Count's fury increases in power;"My wedded existence a curse long has been,

모모And these are the fruits from that flower!'Tis ever denied, and the saying is true,

모모That to wed with the base-born is right;The beggar has borne me a beggarly crew,--"

모모The children they hear with affright.

모모"If the husband, the father, thus treats you with scorn,If the holiest bonds by him rashly are torn,

모모Then come to your father--to me!The beggar may gladden life's pathway forlorn,

모모Though aged and weak he may be.This castle is mine! thou hast made it thy prey,

모모Thy people 'twas put me to flight;The tokens I bear will confirm what I say"--

모모The children they hear with delight.

모모"The king who erst govern'd returneth again,And restores to the Faithful the goods that were ta'en,

모모I'll unseal all my treasures the while;The laws shall be gentle, and peaceful the reign"--

모모The old man thus cries with a smile--"Take courage, my son! all hath turned out for good,

모모And each hath a star that is bright,Those the princess hath borne thee are princely in blood,"--

모모The children thy hear with delight.

모모1816.-----THE VIOLET.

모모UPON the mead a violet stood,Retiring, and of modest mood,

모모In truth, a violet fair.Then came a youthful shepherdess,And roam'd with sprightly joyousness,And blithely woo'd

모모With carols sweet the air

모모"Ah!" thought the violet, "had I beenFor but the smallest moment e'en

모모Nature's most beauteous flower,'Till gather'd by my love, and press'd,When weary, 'gainst her gentle breast,For e'en, for e'en

모모One quarter of an hour!"

모모Alas! alas! the maid drew nigh,The violet failed to meet her eye,

모모She crush'd the violet sweet.It sank and died, yet murmur'd not:"And if I die, oh, happy lot,For her I die,

모모And at her very feet!"

모모1775.*-----THE FAITHLESS BOY.

모모THERE was a wooer blithe and gay,

모모A son of France was he,--Who in his arms for many a day,

모모As though his bride were she,A poor young maiden had caress'd,And fondly kiss'd, and fondly press'd,

모모And then at length deserted.

모모When this was told the nut-brown maid,

모모Her senses straightway fled;She laugh'd and wept, and vow'd and pray'd,

모모And presently was dead.The hour her soul its farewell took,The boy was sad, with terror shook,

모모Then sprang upon his charger.

모모He drove his spurs into his side,

모모And scour'd the country round;But wheresoever he might ride,

모모No rest for him was found.For seven long days and nights he rode,It storm'd, the waters overflow'd,

모모It bluster'd, lighten'd, thunder'd.

모모On rode he through the tempest's din,

모모Till he a building spied;In search of shelter crept he in,

모모When he his steed had tied.And as he groped his doubtful way,The ground began to rock and sway,--

모모He fell a hundred fathoms.

모모When he recover'd from the blow,

모모He saw three lights pass by;He sought in their pursuit to go,

모모The lights appear'd to fly.They led his footsteps all astray,Up, down, through many a narrow way

모모Through ruin'd desert cellars.

모모When lo! he stood within a hall,

모모With hollow eyes. and grinning all;They bade him taste the fare.

모모A hundred guests sat there.He saw his sweetheart 'midst the throng,Wrapp'd up in grave-clothes white and long;

모모She turn'd, and----*

모모1774.(* This ballad is introduced in Act II. of Claudine of VillaBella, where it is suddenly broken off, as it is here.)-----THE ERL-KING.

모모WHO rides there so late through the night dark and drear?The father it is, with his infant so dear;He holdeth the boy tightly clasp'd in his arm,He holdeth him safely, he keepeth him warm.

모모"My son, wherefore seek'st thou thy face thus to hide?""Look, father, the Erl-King is close by our side!Dost see not the Erl-King, with crown and with train?""My son, 'tis the mist rising over the plain."

모모"Oh, come, thou dear infant! oh come thou with me!Full many a game I will play there with thee;On my strand, lovely flowers their blossoms unfold,My mother shall grace thee with garments of gold."

모모"My father, my father, and dost thou not hearThe words that the Erl-King now breathes in mine ear?""Be calm, dearest child, 'tis thy fancy deceives;'Tis the sad wind that sighs through the withering leaves."

모모"Wilt go, then, dear infant, wilt go with me there?My daughters shall tend thee with sisterly careMy daughters by night their glad festival keep,They'll dance thee, and rock thee, and sing thee to sleep."

모모"My father, my father, and dost thou not see,How the Erl-King his daughters has brought here for me?""My darling, my darling, I see it aright,'Tis the aged grey willows deceiving thy sight."

모모"I love thee, I'm charm'd by thy beauty, dear boy!And if thou'rt unwilling, then force I'll employ.""My father, my father, he seizes me fast,Full sorely the Erl-King has hurt me at last."

모모The father now gallops, with terror half wild,He grasps in his arms the poor shuddering child;He reaches his courtyard with toil and with dread,--The child in his arms finds he motionless, dead.

모모1782.*-----JOHANNA SEBUS.

모모[To the memory of an excellent and beautiful girl of 17,belonging to the village of Brienen, who perished on the 13th ofJanuary, 1809, whilst giving help on the occasion of the breakingup of the ice on the Rhine, and the bursting of the dam ofCleverham.]

모모THE DAM BREAKS DOWN, THE ICE-PLAIN GROWLS,THE FLOODS ARISE, THE WATER HOWLS.

모모"I'll bear thee, mother, across the swell,

모모'Tis not yet high, I can wade right well."

모모"Remember us too! in what danger are we!

모모Thy fellow-lodger, and children three!

모모The trembling woman!--Thou'rt going away!"

모모She bears the mother across the spray.

모모"Quick! haste to the mound, and awhile there wait,

모모I'll soon return, and all will be straight.

모모The mound's close by, and safe from the wet;

모모But take my goat too, my darling pet!"

모모THE DAM DISSOLVES, THE ICE-PLAIN GROWLS,THE FLOODS DASH ON, THE WATER HOWLS.

모모She places the mother safe on the shore;

모모Fair Susan then turns tow'rd the flood once more.

모모"Oh whither? Oh whither? The breadth fast grows,

모모Both here and there the water o'erflows.

모모Wilt venture, thou rash one, the billows to brave?""THEY SHALL, AND THEY MUST BE PRESERVED FROM THE WAVE!"

모모THE DAM DISAPPEARS, THE WATER GROWLS,LIKE OCEAN BILLOWS IT HEAVES AND HOWLS.

모모Fair Susan returns by the way she had tried,

모모The waves roar around, but she turns not aside;

모모She reaches the mound, and the neighbour straight,

모모But for her and the children, alas, too late!

모모THE DAM DISAPPEAR'D,--LIKE A SEA IT GROWLS,ROUND THE HILLOCK IN CIRCLING EDDIES IT HOWLS.

모모The foaming abyss gapes wide, and whirls round,

모모The women and children are borne to the ground;

모모The horn of the goat by one is seized fast,

모모But, ah, they all must perish at last!

모모Fair Susan still stands-there, untouch'd by the wave;

모모The youngest, the noblest, oh, who now will save?

모모Fair Susan still stands there, as bright as a star,

모모But, alas! all hope, all assistance is far.

모모The foaming waters around her roar,

모모To save her, no bark pushes off from the shore.

모모Her gaze once again she lifts up to Heaven,

모모Then gently away by the flood she is driven.

모모NO DAM, NO PLAIN! TO MARK THE PLACESOME STRAGGLING TREES ARE THE ONLY TRACE.

모모The rushing water the wilderness covers,

모모Yet Susan's image still o'er it hovers.--

모모The water sinks, the plains re-appear.

모모Fair Susan's lamented with many a tear,--

모모May he who refuses her story to tell,

모모Be neglected in life and in death as well!

모모1809.-----THE FISHERMAN.

모모THE waters rush'd, the waters rose,

모모A fisherman sat by,While on his line in calm repose

모모He cast his patient eye.And as he sat, and hearken'd there,

모모The flood was cleft in twain,And, lo! a dripping mermaid fair

모모Sprang from the troubled main.

모모She sang to him, and spake the while:

모모"Why lurest thou my brood,With human wit and human guile

모모From out their native flood?Oh, couldst thou know how gladly dart

모모The fish across the sea,Thou wouldst descend, e'en as thou art,

모모And truly happy be!

모모"Do not the sun and moon with grace

모모Their forms in ocean lave?Shines not with twofold charms their face,

모모When rising from the wave?The deep, deep heavens, then lure thee not,--

모모The moist yet radiant blue,--Not thine own form,--to tempt thy lot

모모'Midst this eternal dew?"

모모The waters rush'd, the waters rose,

모모Wetting his naked feet;As if his true love's words were those,

모모His heart with longing beat.She sang to him, to him spake she,

모모His doom was fix'd, I ween;Half drew she him, and half sank he,

모모And ne'er again was seen.

모모1779.*-----THE KING OF THULE.*

모모(* This ballad is also introduced in Faust, where it is sung byMargaret.)

모모IN Thule lived a monarch,

모모Still faithful to the grave,To whom his dying mistress

모모A golden goblet gave.

모모Beyond all price he deem'd it,

모모He quaff'd it at each feast;And, when he drain'd that goblet,

모모His tears to flow ne'er ceas'd.

모모And when he felt death near him,

모모His cities o'er he told,And to his heir left all things,

모모But not that cup of gold.

모모A regal banquet held he

모모In his ancestral ball,In yonder sea-wash'd castle,

모모'Mongst his great nobles all.

모모There stood the aged reveller,

모모And drank his last life's-glow,--Then hurl'd the holy goblet

모모Into the flood below.

모모He saw it falling, filling,

모모And sinking 'neath the main,His eyes then closed for ever,

모모He never drank again.

모모THE BEAUTEOUS FLOWER.

모모SONG OF THE IMPRISONED COUNT.

모모COUNT.

모모I KNOW a flower of beauty rare,

모모Ah, how I hold it dear!To seek it I would fain repair,

모모Were I not prison'd here.My sorrow sore oppresses me,For when I was at liberty,

모모I had it close beside me.

모모Though from this castle's walls so steep

모모I cast mine eyes around,And gaze oft from the lofty keep,

모모The flower can not be found.Whoe'er would bring it to my sight,Whether a vassal he, or knight,

모모My dearest friend I'd deem him.

모모THE ROSE.

모모I blossom fair,--thy tale of woes

모모I hear from 'neath thy grate.Thou doubtless meanest me, the rose.

모모Poor knight of high estate!Thou hast in truth a lofty mind;The queen of flowers is then enshrin'd,

모모I doubt not, in thy bosom.

모모COUNT.

모모Thy red, in dress of green array'd,

모모As worth all praise I hold;And so thou'rt treasured by each maid

모모Like precious stones or gold.Thy wreath adorns the fairest faceBut still thou'rt not the flower whose grace

모모I honour here in silence.

모모THE LILY.

모모The rose is wont with pride to swell,

모모And ever seeks to rise;But gentle sweethearts love full well

모모The lily's charms to prize,The heart that fills a bosom true,That is, like me, unsullied too,

모모My merit values duly.

모모COUNT.

모모In truth, I hope myself unstain'd,

모모And free from grievous crime;Yet I am here a prisoner chain'd,

모모And pass in grief my time,To me thou art an image sureOf many a maiden, mild and pure,

모모And yet I know a dearer.

모모THE PINK.

모모That must be me, the pink, who scent

모모The warder's garden here;Or wherefore is he so intent

모모My charms with care to rear?My petals stand in beauteous ring,Sweet incense all around I fling,

모모And boast a thousand colours.

모모COUNT.

모모The pink in truth we should not slight,

모모It is the gardener's prideIt now must stand exposed to light,

모모Now in the shade abide.Yet what can make the Count's heart glowIs no mere pomp of outward show;

모모It is a silent flower.

모모THE VIOLET.

모모Here stand I, modestly half hid,

모모And fain would silence keep;Yet since to speak I now am bid,

모모I'll break my silence deep.If, worthy Knight, I am that flower,It grieves me that I have not power

모모To breathe forth all my sweetness.

모모COUNT.

모모The violet's charms I prize indeed,

모모So modest 'tis, and fair,And smells so sweet; yet more I need

모모To ease my heavy care.The truth I'll whisper in thine ear:Upon these rocky heights so drear,

모모I cannot find the loved one.

모모The truest maiden 'neath the sky

모모Roams near the stream below,And breathes forth many a gentle sigh,

모모Till I from hence can go.And when she plucks a flow'ret blue,And says "Forget-me-not!"--I, too,

모모Though far away, can feel it.

모모Ay, distance only swells love's might,

모모When fondly love a pair;Though prison'd in the dungeon's night,

모모In life I linger thereAnd when my heart is breaking nigh,"Forget-me-not!" is all I cry,

모모And straightway life returneth.

모모1798.-----SIR CURT'S WEDDING-JOURNEY.

모모WITH a bridegroom's joyous bearing,

모모Mounts Sir Curt his noble beast,To his mistress' home repairing,

모모There to hold his wedding feast;When a threatening foe advances

모모From a desert, rocky spot;For the fray they couch their lances,

모모Not delaying, speaking not.

모모Long the doubtful fight continues,

모모Victory then for Curt declares;Conqueror, though with wearied sinews,

모모Forward on his road he fares.When he sees, though strange it may be,

모모Something 'midst the foliage move;'Tis a mother, with her baby,

모모Stealing softly through the grove!

모모And upon the spot she beckons--

모모"Wherefore, love, this speed so wild?Of the wealth thy storehouse reckons,

모모Hast thou nought to give thy child!"Flames of rapture now dart through him,

모모And he longs for nothing more,While the mother seemeth to him

모모Lovely as the maid of yore.

모모But he hears his servants blowing,

모모And bethinks him of his bride;And ere long, while onward going,

모모Chances past a fair to ride;In the booths he forthwith buys him

모모For his mistress many a pledge;But, alas! some Jews surprise him,

모모And long-standing debts allege.

모모And the courts of justice duly

모모Send the knight to prison straight.Oh accursed story, truly!

모모For a hero, what a fate!Can my patience such things weather?

모모Great is my perplexity.Women, debts, and foes together,--

모모Ah, no knight escapes scot free!

모모1803.*-----WEDDING SONG.

모모THE tale of the Count our glad song shall record

모모Who had in this castle his dwelling,Where now ye are feasting the new-married lord,

모모His grandson of whom we are telling.The Count as Crusader had blazon'd his fame,Through many a triumph exalted his name,And when on his steed to his dwelling he came,

모모His castle still rear'd its proud head,But servants and wealth had all fled.

모모'Tis true that thou, Count, hast return'd to thy home,

모모But matters are faring there ill.The winds through the chambers at liberty roam,

모모And blow through the windows at willWhat's best to be done in a cold autumn night?Full many I've pass'd in more piteous plight;The morn ever settles the matter aright.

모모Then quick, while the moon shines so clear,

모모To bed on the straw, without fear,

모모And whilst in a soft pleasing slumber he lay,

모모A motion he feels 'neath his bed.The rat, an he likes it, may rattle away!

모모Ay, had he but crumbs there outspread!But lo! there appears a diminutive wight,A dwarf 'tis, yet graceful, and bearing a light,With orator-gestures that notice invite,

모모At the feet of the Count on the floor

모모Who sleeps not, though weary full sore.

모모"We've long been accustom'd to hold here our feast,

모모Since thou from thy castle first went;And as we believed thou wert far in the East,

모모To revel e'en now we were bent.And if thou'lt allow it, and seek not to chide,We dwarfs will all banquet with pleasure and pride,To honour the wealthy, the beautiful bride

모모Says the Count with a smile, half-asleep;--

모모"Ye're welcome your quarters to keep!"

모모Three knights then advance, riding all in a group,

모모Who under the bed were conceal'd;And then is a singing and noise-making troop

모모Of strange little figures reveal'd;And waggon on waggon with all kinds of things--The clatter they cause through the ear loudly rings--The like ne'er was seen save in castles of kings;

모모At length, in a chariot of gold,

모모The bride and the guests too, behold!

모모Then all at full gallop make haste to advance,

모모Each chooses his place in the hall;With whirling and waltzing, and light joyous dance,

모모They begin with their sweethearts the ball.The fife and the fiddle all merrily sound,Thy twine, and they glide, and with nimbleness bound,Thy whisper, and chatter, and, chatter around;

모모The Count on the scene casts his eye,

모모And seems in a fever to lie.

모모They hustle, and bustle, and rattle away

모모On table, on bench, and on stool;Then all who had joined in the festival gay

모모With their partners attempt to grow cool.The hams and the sausages nimbly they bear,And meat, fish, and poultry in plenty are there,Surrounded with wine of the vintage most rare:

모모And when they have revell'd full long,

모모They vanish at last with a song.

모모*      *      *      *      *      *

모모And if we're to sing all that further occurr'd,

모모Pray cease ye to bluster and prate;For what he so gladly in small saw and heard

모모He enjoy'd and he practis'd in great.For trumpets, and singing, and shouts without endOn the bridal-train, chariots and horsemen attend,They come and appear, and they bow and they bend,

모모In merry and countless array.

모모Thus was it, thus is it to-day.

모모1802.-----THE TREASURE-DIGGER

모모ALL my weary days I pass'd

모모Sick at heart and poor in purse.

모모Poverty's the greatest curse,

모모Riches are the highest good!And to end my woes at last,

모모Treasure-seeking forth I sped.

모모"Thou shalt have my soul instead!"

모모Thus I wrote, and with my blood.

모모Ring round ring I forthwith drew,

모모Wondrous flames collected there,

모모Herbs and bones in order fair,

모모Till the charm had work'd aright.Then, to learned precepts true,

모모Dug to find some treasure old,

모모In the place my art foretold

모모Black and stormy was the night.

모모Coming o'er the distant plain,

모모With the glimmer of a star,

모모Soon I saw a light afar,

모모As the hour of midnight knell'd.Preparation was in vain.

모모Sudden all was lighted up

모모With the lustre of a cup

모모That a beauteous boy upheld.

모모Sweetly seem'd his eves to laugh

모모Neath his flow'ry chaplet's load;

모모With the drink that brightly glow'd,

모모He the circle enter'd in.And he kindly bade me quaff:

모모Then methought "This child can ne'er,

모모With his gift so bright and fair,

모모To the arch-fiend be akin."

모모"Pure life's courage drink!" cried he:"This advice to prize then learn,--

모모Never to this place return

모모Trusting in thy spells absurd;Dig no longer fruitlessly.

모모Guests by night, and toil by day!

모모Weeks laborious, feast-days gay!

모모Be thy future magic-word!

모모1797.-----THE RAT-CATCHER.

모모I AM the bard known far and wide,The travell'd rat-catcher beside;A man most needful to this town,So glorious through its old renown.However many rats I see,How many weasels there may be,I cleanse the place from ev'ry one,All needs must helter-skelter run.

모모Sometimes the bard so full of cheerAs a child-catcher will appear,Who e'en the wildest captive brings,Whene'er his golden tales he sings.However proud each boy in heart,However much the maidens start,I bid the chords sweet music make,And all must follow in my wake.

모모Sometimes the skilful bard ye viewIn the form of maiden-catcher too;For he no city enters e'er,Without effecting wonders there.However coy may be each maid,However the women seem afraid,Yet all will love-sick be ere longTo sound of magic lute and song.

모모[Da Capo.]                  1803.*-----

모모THE SPINNER.

모모As I calmly sat and span,

모모Toiling with all zeal,Lo! a young and handsome man

모모Pass'd my spinning-wheel.

모모And he praised,--what harm was there?--

모모Sweet the things he said--Praised my flax-resembling hair,

모모And the even thread.

모모He with this was not content,

모모But must needs do more;And in twain the thread was rent,

모모Though 'twas safe before.

모모And the flax's stonelike weight

모모Needed to be told;But no longer was its state

모모Valued as of old.

모모When I took it to the weaver,

모모Something felt I start,And more quickly, as with fever,

모모Throbb'd my trembling heart.

모모Then I bear the thread at length

모모Through the heat, to bleach;But, alas, I scarce have strength

모모To the pool to reach.

모모What I in my little room

모모Span so fine and slight,--As was likely. I presume--

모모Came at last to light.

모모1800.*-----BEFORE A COURT OF JUSTICE.

모모THE father's name ye ne'er shall be told

모모Of my darling unborn life;"Shame, shame," ye cry, "on the strumpet bold!"

모모Yet I'm an honest wife.

모모To whom I'm wedded, ye ne'er shall be told,

모모Yet he's both loving and fair;He wears on his neck a chain of gold,

모모And a hat of straw doth he wear.

모모If scorn 'tis vain to seek to repel,

모모On me let the scorn be thrown.I know him well, and he knows me well,

모모And to God, too, all is known.

모모Sir Parson and Sir Bailiff, again,

모모I pray you, leave me in peace!My child it is, my child 'twill remain,

모모So let your questionings cease!

모모1815.*-----THE PAGE AND THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER.

모모PAGE.

모모WHERE goest thou? Where?Miller's daughter so fair!

모모Thy name, pray?--

모모MILLER'S DAUGHTER.

모모'Tis Lizzy.

모모PAGE.Where goest thou? Where?With the rake in thy hand?

모모MILLER'S DAUGHTER.Father's meadows and land

모모To visit, I'm busy.

모모PAGE.Dost go there alone?

모모MILLER'S DAUGHTER.By this rake, sir, 'tis shown

모모That we're making the hay;And the pears ripen fastIn the garden at last,

모모So I'll pick them to-day.

모모PAGE.Is't a silent thicket I yonder view?

모모MILLER'S DAUGHTER.Oh, yes! there are two;There's one on each side.

모모PAGE.I'll follow thee soon;When the sun burns at noonWe'll go there, o'urselves from his rays to hide,And then in some glade all-verdant and deep--

모모MILLER'S DAUGHTER.Why, people would say--

모모PAGE.Within mine arms thou gently wilt sleep.

모모MILLER'S DAUGHTER.

모모Your pardon, I pray!Whoever is kiss'd by the miller-maid,Upon the spot must needs be betray'd.

모모'Twould give me distress

모모To cover with whiteYour pretty dark dress.Equal with equal! then all is right!That's the motto in which I delight.I am in love with the miller-boy;He wears nothing that I could destroy.

모모1797.-----THE YOUTH AND THE MILLSTREAM.

모모[This sweet Ballad, and the one entitled The Maid of the Mill'sRepentance, were written on the occasion of a visit paid by Goetheto Switzerland. The Maid of the Mill's Treachery, to which thelatter forms the sequel, was not written till the following year.]

모모YOUTH.

모모SAY, sparkling streamlet, whither thou

모모Art going!With joyous mien thy waters now

모모Are flowing.Why seek the vale so hastily?Attend for once, and answer me!

모모MILLSTREAM.

모모Oh youth, I was a brook indeed;

모모But latelyMy bed they've deepen'd, and my speed

모모Swell'd greatly,That I may haste to yonder mill.And so I'm full and never still.

모모YOUTH.

모모The mill thou seekest in a mood

모모Contented,And know'st not how my youthful blood

모모'S tormented.But doth the miller's daughter fairGaze often on thee kindly there?

모모MILLSTREAM.

모모She opes the shutters soon as light

모모Is gleaming;And comes to bathe her features bright

모모And beaming.So full and snow-white is her breast,--I feel as hot as steam suppress'd.

모모YOUTH.

모모If she in water can inflame

모모Such ardour,Surely, then, flesh and blood to tame

모모Is harder.When once is seen her beauteous face,One ever longs her steps to trace.

모모MILLSTREAM.

모모Over the wheel I, roaring, bound,

모모All-proudly,And ev'ry spoke whirls swiftly round,

모모And loudly.Since I have seen the miller's daughter,With greater vigour flows the water.

모모YOUTH.

모모Like others, then, can grief, poor brook,

모모Oppress thee?"Flow on!"--thus she'll, with smiling look,

모모Address thee.With her sweet loving glance, oh say,Can she thy flowing current stay?

모모MILLSTREAM.

모모'Tis sad, 'tis sad to have to speed

모모From yonder;I wind, and slowly through the mead

모모Would wander;And if the choice remain'd with me,Would hasten back there presently.

모모YOUTH.

모모Farewell, thou who with me dost prove

모모Love's sadness!Perchance some day thou'lt breathe of love

모모And gladness.Go, tell her straight, and often too,The boy's mute hopes and wishes true.

모모1797.-----

모모THE MAID OF THE MILL'S TREACHERY.

모모[This Ballad is introduced in the Wanderjahre, in a tale calledThe Foolish Pilgrim.]

모모WHENCE comes our friend so hastily,

모모When scarce the Eastern sky is grey?Hath he just ceased, though cold it be,

모모In yonder holy spot to pray?The brook appears to hem his path,

모모Would he barefooted o'er it go?Why curse his orisons in wrath,

모모Across those heights beclad with snow?

모모Alas! his warm bed he bath left,

모모Where he had look'd for bliss, I ween;And if his cloak too, had been reft,

모모How fearful his disgrace had been!By yonder villain sorely press'd,

모모His wallet from him has been torn;Our hapless friend has been undress'd,

모모Left well nigh naked as when born.

모모The reason why he came this road,

모모Is that he sought a pair of eyes,Which, at the mill, as brightly glow'd

모모As those that are in Paradise.He will not soon again be there;

모모From out the house he quickly hied,And when he gain'd the open air,

모모Thus bitterly and loudly cried

모모"Within her gaze, so dazzling bright,

모모No word of treachery I could read;She seem'd to see me with delight,

모모Yet plann'd e'en then this cruel deed!Could I, when basking in her smile,

모모Dream of the treason in her breast?She bade kind Cupid stay awhile,

모모And he was there, to make us blest.

모모"To taste of love's sweet ecstasy

모모Throughout the night, that endless seem'd,And for her mother's help to cry

모모Only when morning sunlight beam'd!A dozen of her kith and kin,

모모A very human flood, in-press'dHer cousins came, her aunts peer'd in,

모모And uncles, brothers, and the rest.

모모"Then what a tumult, fierce and loud!

모모Each seem'd a beast of prey to be;The maiden's honour all the crowd,

모모With fearful shout, demand of me.Why should they, madmen-like, begin

모모To fall upon a guiltless youth?For he who such a prize would win,

모모Far nimbler needs must be, in truth.

모모"The way to follow up with skill

모모His freaks, by love betimes is known:He ne'er will leave, within a mill,

모모Sweet flowers for sixteen years alone.--They stole my clothes away,--yes, all!

모모And tried my cloak besides to steal.How strange that any house so small

모모So many rascals could conceal!

모모"Then I sprang up, and raved, and swore,

모모To force a passage through them there.I saw the treacherous maid once more,

모모And she was still, alas, so fairThey all gave way before my wrath,

모모Wild outcries flew about pell-mell;At length I managed to rush forth,

모모With voice of thunder, from that hell.

모모"As maidens of the town we fly,

모모We'll shun you maidens of the village;Leave it to those of quality

모모Their humble worshippers to pillage.Yet if ye are of practised skill,

모모And of all tender ties afraid,Exchange your lovers, if ye will,

모모But never let them be betray'd."

모모Thus sings he in the winter-night,

모모While not a blade of grass was green.I laugh'd to see his piteous plight,

모모For it was well-deserved, I ween.And may this be the fate of all,

모모Who treat by day their true loves ill,And, with foolhardy daring, crawl

모모By night to Cupid's treacherous mill!

모모1798.-----THE MAID OF THE MILL'S REPENTANCE.

모모YOUTH.

모모AWAY, thou swarthy witch! Go forth

모모From out my house, I tell thee!Or else I needs must, in my wrath,

모모Expel thee!What's this thou singest so falsely, forsooth,Of love and a maiden's silent truth?

모모Who'll trust to such a story!

모모GIPSY.

모모I sing of a maid's repentant fears,

모모And long and bitter yearning;Her levity's changed to truth and tears

모모All-burning.She dreads no more the threats of her mother,She dreads far less the blows of her brother,

모모Than the dearly loved-one's hatred.

모모YOUTH.

모모Of selfishness sing and treacherous lies,

모모Of murder and thievish plunder!Such actions false will cause no surprise,

모모Or wonder.When  they share their booty, both clothes and purse,--As bad as you gipsies, and even worse,

모모Such tales find ready credence.

모모GIPSY.

모모"Alas, alas! oh what have I done?

모모Can listening aught avail me?I hear him toward my room hasten on,

모모To hail me.My heart beat high, to myself I said:'O would that thou hadst never betray'd

모모That night of love to thy mother!'"

모모YOUTH.

모모Alas! I foolishly ventured there,

모모For the cheating silence misled me;Ah, sweetest! let me to thee repair,--

모모Nor dread me!When suddenly rose a fearful din,Her mad relations came pouring in.

모모My blood still boils in my body!

모모GIPSY.

모모"Oh when will return an hour like this?

모모I pine in silent sadness;I've thrown away my only true bliss

모모With madness.Alas, poor maid! O pity my youth!My brother was then full cruel in troth

모모To treat the loved one so basely!"

모모THE POET.

모모The swarthy woman then went inside,

모모To the spring in the courtyard yonder;Her eyes from their stain she purified,

모모And,--wonder!--Her face and eyes were radiant and bright,And the maid of the mill was disclosed to the sight

모모Of the startled and angry stripling!

모모THE MAID OF THE MILL.

모모Thou sweetest, fairest, dearly-loved life!

모모Before thine anger I cower;But blows I dread not, nor sharp-edged knife,--

모모This hourOf sorrow and love to thee I'll sing,And myself before thy feet I'll fling,

모모And either live or die there!

모모YOUTH.

모모Affection, say, why buried so deep

모모In my heart hast thou lain hidden?By whom hast thou now to awake from thy sleep

모모Been bidden?Ah love, that thou art immortal I see!Nor knavish cunning nor treachery

모모Can destroy thy life so godlike.

모모THE MAID OF THE MILL.

모모If still with as fond and heartfelt love,

모모As thou once didst swear, I'm cherish'd,Then nought of the rapture we used to prove

모모Is perish'd.So take the woman so dear to thy breast!In her young and innocent charms be blest,

모모For all are thine from henceforward!

모모BOTH.

모모Now, sun, sink to rest! Now, sun, arise!

모모Ye stars, be now shining, now darkling!A star of love now gleams in the skies,

모모All-sparkling!As long as the fountain may spring and run,So long will we two be blended in one,

모모Upon each other's bosoms!

모모1797.-----THE TRAVELLER AND THE FARM~MAIDEN.

모모HE.

모모CANST thou give, oh fair and matchless maiden,

모모'Neath the shadow of the lindens yonder,--

모모Where I'd fain one moment cease to wander,--Food and drink to one so heavy laden?

모모SHE.

모모Wouldst thou find refreshment, traveller weary,

모모Bread, ripe fruit and cream to meet thy wishes,--

모모None but Nature's plain and homely dishes,--Near the spring may soothe thy wanderings dreary.

모모HE.

모모Dreams of old acquaintance now pass through me,

모모Ne'er-forgotten queen of hours of blisses.

모모Likenesses I've often found, but this isOne that quite a marvel seemeth to me!

모모SHE.

모모Travellers often wonder beyond measure,

모모But their wonder soon see cause to smother;

모모Fair and dark are often like each other,Both inspire the mind with equal pleasure.

모모HE.

모모Not now for the first time I surrender

모모To this form, in humble adoration;

모모It was brightest midst the constellationIn the hail adorn'd with festal splendour.

모모SHE.

모모Be thou joyful that 'tis in my power

모모To complete thy strange and merry story!

모모Silks behind her, full of purple glory,Floated, when thou saw'st her in that hour.

모모HE.

모모No, in truth, thou hast not sung it rightly!

모모Spirits may have told thee all about it;

모모Pearls and gems they spoke of, do not doubt it,--By her gaze eclipsed,--it gleam'd so brightly!

모모SHE.

모모This one thing I certainly collected:

모모That the fair one--(say nought, I entreat thee!)

모모Fondly hoping once again to meet thee,Many a castle in the air erected.

모모HE.

모모By each wind I ceaselessly was driven,

모모Seeking gold and honour, too, to capture!

모모When my wand'rings end, then oh, what rapture,If to find that form again 'tis given!

모모SHE.

모모'Tis the daughter of the race now banish'd

모모That thou seest, not her likeness only;

모모Helen and her brother, glad though lonely,Till this farm of their estate now vanish'd.

모모HE.

모모But the owner surely is not wanting

모모Of these plains, with ev'ry beauty teeming?

모모Verdant fields, broad meads, and pastures gleaming,Gushing springs, all heav'nly and enchanting.

모모SHE.

모모Thou must hunt the world through, wouldst thou find him!--

모모We have wealth enough in our possession,

모모And intend to purchase the succession,When the good man leaves the world behind him.

모모HE.

모모I have learnt the owner's own condition,

모모And, fair maiden, thou indeed canst buy it;

모모But the cost is great, I won't deny it,--Helen is the price,--with thy permission!

모모SHE.

모모Did then fate and rank keep us asunder,

모모And must Love take this road, and no other?

모모Yonder comes my dear and trusty brother;What will he say to it all, I wonder?

모모1803.*-----EFFECTS AT A DISTANCE.

모모THE queen in the lofty hall takes her place,

모모The tapers around her are flaming;She speaks to the page: "With a nimble pace

모모Go, fetch me my purse for gaming.

모모'Tis lying, I'll pledge,

모모On my table's edge."Each nerve the nimble boy straineth,And the end of the castle soon gaineth.

모모The fairest of maidens was sipping sherbet

모모Beside the queen that minute;Near her mouth broke the cup,--and she got so wet!

모모The very devil seem'd in it

모모What fearful distress

모모'Tis spoilt, her gay dress.She hastens, and ev'ry nerve straineth,And the end of the castle soon gaineth.

모모The boy was returning, and quickly came,

모모And met the sorrowing maiden;None knew of the fact,--and yet with Love's flame,

모모Those two had their hearts full laden.

모모And, oh the bliss

모모Of a moment like this!Each falls on the breast of the other,With kisses that well nigh might smother.

모모They tear themselves asunder at last,

모모To her chamber she hastens quickly,To reach the queen the page hies him fast,

모모Midst the swords and the fans crowded thickly.

모모The queen spied amain

모모On his waistcoat a stain;For nought was inscrutable to her,Like Sheba's queen--Solomon's wooer.

모모To her chief attendant she forthwith cried

모모"We lately together contended,And thou didst assert, with obstinate pride,

모모That the spirit through space never wended,--

모모That traces alone

모모By the present were shown,--That afar nought was fashion'd--not evenBy the stars that illumine you heaven.

모모"Now see! while a goblet beside me they drain'd,

모모They spilt all the drink in the chalice;And straightway the boy had his waistcoat stain'd

모모At the furthermost end of the palace.--

모모Let them newly be clad!

모모And since I am gladThat it served as a proof so decided,The cost will by me be provided."

모모1808.-----THE WALKING BELL

모모A CHILD refused to go betimes

모모To church like other people;He roam'd abroad, when rang the chimes

모모On Sundays from the steeple.

모모His mother said: "Loud rings the bell,

모모Its voice ne'er think of scorning;Unless thou wilt behave thee well,

모모'Twill fetch thee without warning."

모모The child then thought: "High over head

모모The bell is safe suspended--"So to the fields he straightway sped

모모As if 'twas school-time ended.

모모The bell now ceas'd as bell to ring,

모모Roused by the mother's twaddle;But soon ensued a dreadful thing!--

모모The bell begins to waddle.

모모It waddles fast, though strange it seem;

모모The child, with trembling wonder,Runs off, and flies, as in a dream;

모모The bell would draw him under.

모모He finds the proper time at last,

모모And straightway nimbly rushesTo church, to chapel, hastening fast

모모Through pastures, plains, and bushes.

모모Each Sunday and each feast as well,

모모His late disaster heeds he;The moment that he bears the bell,

모모No other summons needs he.

모모1813.-----FAITHFUL ECKART,

모모"OH, would we were further! Oh, would we were home,The phantoms of night tow'rd us hastily come,

모모The band of the Sorceress sisters.They hitherward speed, and on finding us here,They'll drink, though with toil we have fetch'd it, the beer,

모모And leave us the pitchers all empty."

모모Thus speaking, the children with fear take to flight,When sudden an old man appears in their sight:

모모"Be quiet, child! children, be quiet!From hunting they come, and their thirst they would still,So leave them to swallow as much as they will,

모모And the Evil Ones then will be gracious."

모모As said, so 'twas done! and the phantoms draw near,And shadowlike seem they, and grey they appear,

모모~Yet blithely they sip and they revelThe beer has all vanish'd, the pitchers are void;With cries and with shouts the wild hunters, o'erjoy'd,

모모Speed onward o'er vale and o'er mountain.

모모The children in terror fly nimbly tow'rd home,And with them the kind one is careful to come:

모모"My darlings, oh, be not so mournful!--"They'll blame us and beat us, until we are dead."--"No, no! ye will find that all goes well," he said;

모모"Be silent as mice, then, and listen!

모모"And he by whose counsels thus wisely ye're taught,Is he who with children loves ever to sport.

모모The trusty and faithful old Eckart.Ye have heard of the wonder for many a day,But ne'er had a proof of the marvellous lay,--

모모Your hands hold a proof most convincing."

모모They arrive at their home, and their pitchers they placeBy the side of their parents, with fear on their face,

모모Awaiting a beating and scolding.But see what they're tasting: the choicest of beer!Though three times and four times they quaff the good cheer

모모The pitchers remain still unemptied.

모모The marvel it lasts till the dawning of day;All people who hear of it doubtless will say:

모모"What happen'd at length to the pitchers?"In secret the children they smile, as they wait;At last, though, they stammer, and stutter, and prate,

모모And straightway the pitchers were empty.

모모And if, children, with kindness address'd ye may be,Whether father, or master, or alderman he,

모모Obey him, and follow his bidding!And if 'tis unpleasant to bridle the tongue,Yet talking is bad, silence good for the young--

모모And then will the beer fill your pitchers!

모모1813.-----THE DANCE OF DEATH.

모모THE warder looks down at the mid hour of night,

모모On the tombs that lie scatter'd below:The moon fills the place with her silvery light,

모모And the churchyard like day seems to glow.When see! first one grave, then another opes wide,And women and men stepping forth are descried,

모모In cerements snow-white and trailing.

모모In haste for the sport soon their ankles they twitch,

모모And whirl round in dances so gay;The young and the old, and the poor, and the rich,

모모But the cerements stand in their way;And as modesty cannot avail them aught here,They shake themselves all, and the shrouds soon appear

모모Scatter'd over the tombs in confusion.

모모Now waggles the leg, and now wriggles the thigh,

모모As the troop with strange gestures advance,And a rattle and clatter anon rises high,

모모As of one beating time to the dance.The sight to the warder seems wondrously queer,When the villainous Tempter speaks thus in his ear:

모모"Seize one of the shrouds that lie yonder!"

모모Quick as thought it was done! and for safety he fled

모모Behind the church-door with all speed;The moon still continues her clear light to shed

모모On the dance that they fearfully lead.But the dancers at length disappear one by one,And their shrouds, ere they vanish, they carefully don,

모모And under the turf all is quiet.

모모But one of them stumbles and shuffles there still,

모모And gropes at the graves in despair;Yet 'tis by no comrade he's treated so ill

모모The shroud he soon scents in the air.So he rattles the door--for the warder 'tis wellThat 'tis bless'd, and so able the foe to repel,

모모All cover'd with crosses in metal.

모모The shroud he must have, and no rest will allow,

모모There remains for reflection no time;On the ornaments Gothic the wight seizes now,

모모And from point on to point hastes to climb.Alas for the warder! his doom is decreed!Like a long-legged spider, with ne'er-changing speed,

모모Advances the dreaded pursuer.

모모The warder he quakes, and the warder turns pale,

모모The shroud to restore fain had sought;When the end,--now can nothing to save him avail,--

모모In a tooth formed of iron is caught.With vanishing lustre the moon's race is run,When the bell thunders loudly a powerful One,

모모And the skeleton fails, crush'd to atoms.

모모1813.-----THE PUPIL IN MAGIC.

모모I AM now,--what joy to hear it!--

모모Of the old magician rid;And henceforth shall ev'ry spirit

모모Do whate'er by me is bid;

모모I have watch'd with rigour

모모All he used to do,

모모And will now with vigour

모모Work my wonders too.

모모Wander, wander

모모Onward lightly,

모모So that rightly

모모Flow the torrent,

모모And with teeming waters yonder

모모In the bath discharge its current!

모모And now come, thou well-worn broom,

모모And thy wretched form bestir;Thou hast ever served as groom,

모모So fulfil my pleasure, sir!

모모On two legs now stand,

모모With a head on top;

모모Waterpail in hand,

모모Haste, and do not stop!

모모Wander, wander

모모Onward lightly,

모모So that rightly

모모Flow the torrent,

모모And with teeming waters yonder

모모In the bath discharge its current!

모모See! he's running to the shore,

모모And has now attain'd the pool,And with lightning speed once more

모모Comes here, with his bucket full!

모모Back he then repairs;

모모See how swells the tide!

모모How each pail he bears

모모Straightway is supplied!

모모Stop, for, lo!

모모All the measure

모모Of thy treasure

모모Now is right!--

모모Ah, I see it! woe, oh woe!

모모I forget the word of might.

모모Ah, the word whose sound can straight

모모Make him what he was before!Ah, he runs with nimble gait!

모모Would thou wert a broom once more!

모모Streams renew'd for ever

모모Quickly bringeth he;

모모River after river

모모Rusheth on poor me!

모모Now no longer

모모Can I bear him;

모모I will snare him,

모모Knavish sprite!

모모Ah, my terror waxes stronger!

모모What a look! what fearful sight

모모Oh, thou villain child of hell!

모모Shall the house through thee be drown'dFloods I see that wildly swell,

모모O'er the threshold gaining ground.

모모Wilt thou not obey,

모모Oh, thou broom accurs'd?

모모Be thou still I pray,

모모As thou wert at first!

모모Will enough

모모Never please thee?

모모I will seize thee,

모모Hold thee fast,

모모And thy nimble wood so tough,

모모With my sharp axe split at last.

모모See, once more he hastens back!

모모Now, oh Cobold, thou shalt catch it!I will rush upon his track;

모모Crashing on him falls my hatchet.

모모Bravely done, indeed!

모모See, he's cleft in twain!

모모Now from care I'm freed,

모모And can breathe again.

모모Woe, oh woe!

모모Both the parts,

모모Quick as darts,

모모Stand on end,

모모Servants of my dreaded foe!

모모Oh, ye gods protection send!

모모And they run! and wetter still

모모Grow the steps and grows the hail.Lord and master hear me call!

모모Ever seems the flood to fill,

모모Ah, he's coming! see,

모모Great is my dismay!

모모Spirits raised by me

모모Vainly would I lay!

모모"To the side

모모Of the room

모모Hasten, broom,

모모As of old!

모모Spirits I have ne'er untied

모모Save to act as they are told."

모모1797.-----THE BRIDE OF CORINTH.

모모[First published in Schiller's Horen, in connection with afriendly contest in the art of ballad-writing between the twogreat poets, to which many of their finest works are owing.]

모모ONCE a stranger youth to Corinth came,

모모Who in Athens lived, but hoped that heFrom a certain townsman there might claim,

모모As his father's friend, kind courtesy.

모모Son and daughter, they

모모Had been wont to say

모모Should thereafter bride and bridegroom be.

모모But can he that boon so highly prized,

모모Save tis dearly bought, now hope to get?They are Christians and have been baptized,

모모He and all of his are heathens yet.

모모For a newborn creed,

모모Like some loathsome weed,

모모Love and truth to root out oft will threat.

모모Father, daughter, all had gone to rest,

모모And the mother only watches late;She receives with courtesy the guest,

모모And conducts him to the room of state.

모모Wine and food are brought,

모모Ere by him besought;

모모Bidding him good night. she leaves him straight.

모모But he feels no relish now, in truth,

모모For the dainties so profusely spread;Meat and drink forgets the wearied youth,

모모And, still dress'd, he lays him on the bed.

모모Scarce are closed his eyes,

모모When a form in-hies

모모Through the open door with silent tread.

모모By his glimmering lamp discerns he now

모모How, in veil and garment white array'd,With a black and gold band round her brow,

모모Glides into the room a bashful maid.

모모But she, at his sight,

모모Lifts her hand so white,

모모And appears as though full sore afraid.

모모"Am I," cries she, "such a stranger here,

모모That the guest's approach they could not name?Ah, they keep me in my cloister drear,

모모Well nigh feel I vanquish'd by my shame.

모모On thy soft couch now

모모Slumber calmly thou!

모모I'll return as swiftly as I came."

모모"Stay, thou fairest maiden!" cries the boy,

모모Starting from his couch with eager haste:"Here are Ceres', Bacchus' gifts of joy;

모모Amor bringest thou, with beauty grac'd!

모모Thou art pale with fear!

모모Loved one let us here

모모Prove the raptures the Immortals taste."

모모"Draw not nigh, O Youth! afar remain!

모모Rapture now can never smile on me;For the fatal step, alas! is ta'en,

모모Through my mother's sick-bed phantasy.

모모Cured, she made this oath:

모모'Youth and nature both

모모Shall henceforth to Heav'n devoted be.'

모모"From the house, so silent now, are driven

모모All the gods who reign'd supreme of yore;One Invisible now rules in heaven,

모모On the cross a Saviour they adore.

모모Victims slay they here,

모모Neither lamb nor steer,But the altars reek with human gore."

모모And he lists, and ev'ry word he weighs,

모모While his eager soul drinks in each sound:"Can it be that now before my gaze

모모Stands my loved one on this silent ground?

모모Pledge to me thy troth!

모모Through our father's oath:

모모With Heav'ns blessing will our love be crown'd."

모모"Kindly youth, I never can be thine!

모모'Tis my sister they intend for thee.When I in the silent cloister pine,

모모Ah, within her arms remember me!

모모Thee alone I love,

모모While love's pangs I prove;

모모Soon the earth will veil my misery."

모모"No! for by this glowing flame I swear,

모모Hymen hath himself propitious shown:Let us to my fathers house repair,

모모And thoult find that joy is not yet flown,

모모Sweetest, here then stay,

모모And without delay

모모Hold we now our wedding feast alone!"

모모Then exchange they tokens of their truth;

모모She gives him a golden chain to wear,And a silver chalice would the youth

모모Give her in return of beauty rare.

모모"That is not for me;

모모Yet I beg of thee,One lock only give me of thy hair."

모모Now the ghostly hour of midnight knell'd,

모모And she seem'd right joyous at the sign;To her pallid lips the cup she held,

모모But she drank of nought but blood-red wine.

모모For to taste the bread

모모There before them spread,

모모Nought he spoke could make the maid incline.

모모To the youth the goblet then she brought,--

모모He too quaff'd with eager joy the bowl.Love to crown the silent feast he sought,

모모Ah! full love-sick was the stripling's soul.

모모From his prayer she shrinks,

모모Till at length he sinks

모모On the bed and weeps without control.

모모And she comes, and lays her near the boy:

모모"How I grieve to see thee sorrowing so!If thou think'st to clasp my form with joy,

모모Thou must learn this secret sad to know;

모모Yes! the maid, whom thou

모모Call'st thy loved one now,

모모Is as cold as ice, though white as snow."

모모Then he clasps her madly in his arm,

모모While love's youthful might pervades his frame:"Thou might'st hope, when with me, to grow warm,

모모E'en if from the grave thy spirit came!

모모Breath for breath, and kiss!

모모Overflow of bliss!

모모Dost not thou, like me, feel passion's flame?"

모모Love still closer rivets now their lips,

모모Tears they mingle with their rapture blest,From his mouth the flame she wildly sips,

모모Each is with the other's thought possess'd.

모모His hot ardour's flood

모모Warms her chilly blood,

모모But no heart is beating in her breast.

모모In her care to see that nought went wrong,

모모Now the mother happen'd to draw near;At the door long hearkens she, full long,

모모Wond'ring at the sounds that greet her ear.

모모Tones of joy and sadness,

모모And love's blissful madness,

모모As of bride and bridegroom they appear,

모모From the door she will not now remove

모모'Till she gains full certainty of this;And with anger hears she vows of love,

모모Soft caressing words of mutual bliss.

모모"Hush! the cock's loud strain!

모모But thoult come again,

모모When the night returns!"--then kiss on kiss.

모모Then her wrath the mother cannot hold,

모모But unfastens straight the lock with ease"In this house are girls become so bold,

모모As to seek e'en strangers' lusts to please?"

모모By her lamp's clear glow

모모Looks she in,--and oh!

모모Sight of horror!--'tis her child she sees.

모모Fain the youth would, in his first alarm,

모모With the veil that o'er her had been spread,With the carpet, shield his love from harm;

모모But she casts them from her, void of dread,

모모And with spirit's strength,

모모In its spectre length,

모모Lifts her figure slowly from the bed.

모모"Mother! mother!"--Thus her wan lips say:

모모"May not I one night of rapture share?From the warm couch am I chased away?

모모Do I waken only to despair?

모모It contents not thee

모모To have driven me

모모An untimely shroud of death to wear?

모모"But from out my coffin's prison-bounds

모모By a wond'rous fate I'm forced to rove,While the blessings and the chaunting sounds

모모That your priests delight in, useless prove.

모모Water, salt, are vain

모모Fervent youth to chain,

모모Ah, e'en Earth can never cool down love!

모모"When that infant vow of love was spoken,

모모Venus' radiant temple smiled on both.Mother! thou that promise since hast broken,

모모Fetter'd by a strange, deceitful oath.

모모Gods, though, hearken ne'er,

모모Should a mother swear

모모To deny her daughter's plighted troth.

모모From my grave to wander I am forc'd,

모모Still to seek The Good's long-sever'd link,Still to love the bridegroom I have lost,

모모And the life-blood of his heart to drink;

모모When his race is run,

모모I must hasten on,

모모And the young must 'neath my vengeance sink,

모모"Beauteous youth! no longer mayst thou live;

모모Here must shrivel up thy form so fair;Did not I to thee a token give,

모모Taking in return this lock of hair?

모모View it to thy sorrow!

모모Grey thoult be to-morrow,

모모Only to grow brown again when there.

모모"Mother, to this final prayer give ear!

모모Let a funeral pile be straightway dress'd;Open then my cell so sad and drear,

모모That the flames may give the lovers rest!

모모When ascends the fire

모모From the glowing pyre,

모모To the gods of old we'll hasten, blest."

모모1797.-----THE GOD AND THE BAYADERE.

모모AN INDIAN LEGEND.

모모[This very fine Ballad was also first given in the Horen.](MAHADEVA is one of the numerous names of Seeva, the destroyer,--the great god of the Brahmins.)

모모MAHADEVA,* Lord of earth

모모For the sixth time comes below,

모모As a man of mortal birth,--

모모Like him, feeling joy and woe.

모모Hither loves he to repair,

모모And his power behind to leave;

모모If to punish or to spare,

모모Men as man he'd fain perceive.And when he the town as a trav'ller hath seen,Observing the mighty, regarding the mean,He quits it, to go on his journey, at eve.

모모He was leaving now the place,

모모When an outcast met his eyes,--

모모Fair in form, with painted face,--

모모Where some straggling dwellings rise.

모모"Maiden, hail!"--"Thanks! welcome here!

모모Stay!--I'll join thee in the road.'

모모"Who art thou?"--"A Bayadere,

모모And this house is love's abode."The cymbal she hastens to play for the dance,Well skill'd in its mazes the sight to entrance,Then by her with grace is the nosegay bestow'd.

모모Then she draws him, as in play,

모모O'er the threshold eagerly:

모모"Beauteous stranger, light as day

모모Thou shalt soon this cottage see.

모모I'll refresh thee, if thou'rt tired,

모모And will bathe thy weary feet;

모모Take whate'er by thee's desired,

모모Toying, rest, or rapture sweet."--She busily seeks his feign'd suff'rings to ease;Then smiles the Immortal; with pleasure he seesThat with kindness a heart so corrupted can beat.

모모And he makes her act the part

모모Of a slave; he's straight obey'd.

모모What at first had been but art,

모모Soon is nature in the maid.

모모By degrees the fruit we find,

모모Where the buds at first obtain;

모모When obedience fills the mind,

모모Love will never far remain.But sharper and sharper the maiden to prove,The Discerner of all things below and above,Feigns pleasure, and horror, and maddening pain.

모모And her painted cheeks he kisses,

모모And his vows her heart enthrall;

모모Feeling love's sharp pangs and blisses,

모모Soon her tears begin to fall.

모모At his feet she now must sink,

모모Not with thoughts of lust or gain,--

모모And her slender members shrink,

모모And devoid of power remain.And so the bright hours with gladness prepareTheir dark, pleasing veil of a texture so fair,And over the couch softly, tranquilly reign.

모모Late she falls asleep, thus bless'd,--

모모Early wakes, her slumbers fled,

모모And she finds the much-loved guest

모모On her bosom lying dead.

모모Screaming falls she on him there,

모모But, alas, too late to save!

모모And his rigid limbs they bear

모모Straightway to their fiery grave.Then hears she the priests and the funeral song,Then madly she runs, and she severs the throng:"Why press tow'rd the pile thus? Why scream thus, and rave?"

모모Then she sinks beside his bier,

모모And her screams through air resound:

모모"I must seek my spouse so dear,

모모E'en if in the grave he's bound.

모모Shall those limbs of grace divine

모모Fall to ashes in my sight?

모모Mine he was! Yes, only mine!

모모Ah, one single blissful night!"The priests chaunt in chorus: "We bear out the old,When long they've been weary, and late they've grown cold:We bear out the young, too, so thoughtless and light.

모모"To thy priests' commands give ear!

모모This one was thy husband ne'er;

모모Live still as a Bayadere,

모모And no duty thou need'st share.

모모To deaths silent realms from life,

모모None but shades attend man's frame,

모모With the husband, none but wife,--

모모That is duty, that is fame.Ye trumpets, your sacred lament haste to raiseOh, welcome, ye gods, the bright lustre of days!Oh, welcome to heaven the youth from the flame!"

모모Thus increased her torments are

모모By the cruel, heartless quire;

모모And with arms outstretching far

모모Leaps she on the glowing pyre.

모모But the youth divine outsprings

모모From the flame with heav'nly grace,

모모And on high his flight he wings,

모모While his arms his love embrace.In the sinner repentant the Godhead feels joy;Immortals delight thus their might to employ.Lost children to raise to a heavenly place.

모모1797.-----THE PARIAH.

모모I.  THE PARIAH S PRAYER.

모모DREADED Brama, lord of might!

모모All proceed from thee alone;Thou art he who judgeth right!

모모Dost thou none but Brahmins own?Do but Rajahs come from thee?

모모None but those of high estate?

모모Didst not thou the ape create,Aye, and even such as we?

모모We are not of noble kind,

모모For with woe our lot is rife;And what others deadly find

모모Is our only source of life.Let this be enough for men,

모모Let them, if they will, despise us;

모모But thou, Brama, thou shouldst prize us,All are equal in thy ken.

모모Now that, Lord, this prayer is said,

모모As thy child acknowledge me;Or let one be born in-stead,

모모Who may link me on to thee!Didst not thou a Bayadere

모모As a goddess heavenward raise?

모모And we too to swell thy praise,Such a miracle would hear.

모모1821.-----II. LEGEND.

모모[The successful manner in which Goethe employs the simplerhymeless trochaic metre in this and in many other Poems willperhaps be remarked by the reader.]

모모WATER-FETCHING goes the nobleBrahmin's wife, so pure and lovely;He is honour'd, void of blemish.And of justice rigid, stern.Daily from the sacred riverBrings she back refreshments precious;--But where is the pail and pitcher?She of neither stands in need.For with pure heart, hands unsullied,She the water lifts, and rolls itTo a wondrous ball of crystalThis she bears with gladsome bosom,Modestly, with graceful motion,To her husband in the house.

모모She to-day at dawn of morningPraying comes to Ganges' waters,Bends her o'er the glassy surface--Sudden, in the waves reflected,Flying swiftly far above her,From the highest heavens descending,She discerns the beauteous formOf a youth divine, createdBy the God's primeval wisdomIn his own eternal breast.

모모When she sees him, straightway feels sheWondrous, new, confused sensationsIn her inmost, deepest being;Fain she'd linger o'er the vision,Then repels it,--it returneth,--And, perplex'd, she bends her flood-wardsWith uncertain hands to draw it;But, alas, she draws no more!For the water's sacred billowsSeem to fly, to hasten from her;She but sees the fearful chasmOf a whirlpool black disclosed.

모모Arms drop down, and footsteps stumble,Can this be the pathway homewards?Shall she fly, or shall she tarry?Can she think, when thought and counsel,When assistance all are lost?So before her spouse appears she--On her looks he--look is judgment--Proudly on the sword he seizes,To the hill of death he drags her,Where delinquents' blood pays forfeit.What resistance could she offer?What excuses could she proffer,Guilty, knowing not her guilt?

모모And with bloody sword returns he,Musing, to his silent dwelling,When his son before him stands:"Whose this blood? Oh, father! father!""The delinquent woman's!"--"Never!For upon the sword it dries not,Like the blood of the delinquent;Fresh it flows, as from the wound.Mother! mother! hither hasten!Unjust never was my father,Tell me what he now hath done."--"Silence! silence! hers the blood is!""Whose, my father?"--"Silence! Silence!""What! oh what! my mother's blood!What her crime? What did she? Answer!Now, the sword! the sword now hold I;Thou thy wife perchance might'st slaughter,But my mother might'st not slay!Through the flames the wife is ableHer beloved spouse to follow,And his dear and only motherThrough the sword her faithful son.""Stay! oh stay!" exclaim'd the father:"Yet 'tis time, so hasten, hasten!Join the head upon the body,With the sword then touch the figure,And, alive she'll follow thee."

모모Hastening, he, with breathless wonder,Sees the bodies of two womenLying crosswise, and their heads too;Oh, what horror! which to choose!Then his mother's head he seizes,--Does not kiss it, deadly pale 'tis,--On the nearest headless bodyPuts it quickly, and then blessesWith the sword the pious work.Then the giant form uprises,--From the dear lips of his mother,Lips all god-like--changeless--blissful,Sound these words with horror fraught:"Son, oh son! what overhast'ning!Yonder is thy mother's body,Near it lies the impious headOf the woman who hath fallenVictim to the judgment-sword!To her body I am graftedBy thy hand for endless ages;Wise in counsel, wild in action,I shall be amongst the gods.E'en the heav'nly boy's own image,Though in eye and brow so lovely,Sinking downwards to the bosomMad and raging lust will stir.

모모"'Twill return again for ever,Ever rising, ever sinking,Now obscured, and now transfigur'd,--So great Brama hath ordain'd.He 'twas sent the beauteous pinions,Radiant face and slender membersOf the only God-begotten,That I might be proved and tempted;For from high descends temptation,When the gods ordain it so.And so I, the Brahmin woman,With my head in Heaven reclining,Must experience, as a Pariah,The debasing power of earth.

모모Son, I send thee to thy father!Comfort him! Let no sad penance,Weak delay, or thought of merit,Hold thee in the desert fastWander on through ev'ry nation,Roam abroad throughout all ages,And proclaim to e'en the meanest,That great Brama hears his cry!

모모"None is in his eyes the meanest--He whose limbs are lame and palsied,He whose soul is wildly riven,Worn with sorrow, hopeless, helpless,Be he Brahmin, be he Pariah,If tow'rd heaven he turns his gaze,Will perceive, will learn to know it:Thousand eyes are glowing yonder,Thousand ears are calmly list'ning,From which nought below is hid.

모모"If I to his throne soar upward,If he sees my fearful figureBy his might transform'd to horror,He for ever will lament it,--May it to your good be found!And I now will kindly warn him,And I now will madly tell himWhatsoe'er my mind conceiveth,What within my bosom heaveth.But my thoughts, my inmost feelings--Those a secret shall remain."

모모1821.-----III.  THE PARIAH'S THANKS.

모모MIGHTY Brama, now I'll bless thee!

모모'Tis from thee that worlds proceed!As my ruler I confess thee,

모모For of all thou takest heed.

모모All thy thousand ears thou keepest

모모Open to each child of earth;We, 'mongst mortals sunk the deepest,

모모Have from thee received new birth.

모모Bear in mind the woman's story,

모모Who, through grief, divine became;Now I'll wait to view His glory,

모모Who omnipotence can claim.

모모1821.-----DEATH-LAMENT OF THE NOBLE WIFE OF ASAN AGA.

모모[From the Morlack.)

모모WHAT is yonder white thing in the forest?Is it snow, or can it swans perchance be?Were it snow, ere this it had been melted,Were it swans, they all away had hastend.Snow, in truth, it is not, swans it is not,'Tis the shining tents of Asan Aga.He within is lying, sorely wounded;To him come his mother and his sister;Bashfully his wife delays to come there.When the torment of his wounds had lessen'd,To his faithful wife he sent this message:"At my court no longer dare to tarry,At my court, or e'en amongst my people."

모모When the woman heard this cruel message,Mute and full of sorrow stood that true one.At the doors she hears the feet of horses,And bethinks that Asan comes--her husband,To the tower she springs, to leap thence headlong,Her two darling daughters follow sadly,And whilst weeping bitter tears, exclaim they:These are not our father Asan's horses;'Tis thy brother Pintorowich coming!"

모모So the wife of Asan turns to meet him,Clasps her arms in anguish round her brother:"See thy sister's sad disgrace, oh brother!How I'm banish'd--mother of five children!"Silently her brother from his wallet,Wrapp'd in deep red-silk, and ready written,Draweth forth the letter of divorcement,To return home to her mother's dwelling,Free to be another's wife thenceforward.

모모When the woman saw that mournful letter,Fervently she kiss'd her two sons' foreheads,And her two girls' cheeks with fervour kiss'd she,But she from the suckling in the cradleCould not tear herself, so deep her sorrow!So she's torn thence by her fiery brother,On his nimble steed he lifts her quickly,And so hastens, with the heart-sad woman,Straightway tow'rd his father's lofty dwelling.

모모Short the time was--seven days had pass'd not,--Yet enough 'twas; many mighty princesSought the woman in her widow's-mourning.Sought the woman,--as their wife they sought her.And the mightiest was Imoski's Cadi,And the woman weeping begg'd her brother:By thy life, my brother, I entreat thee,Let me not another's wife be ever,Lest my heart be broken at the imageOf my poor, my dearly-cherish'd children!"

모모To her prayer her brother would not hearken,Fix'd to wed her to Imoski's Cadi.Yet the good one ceaselessly implored him:"Send, at least a letter, oh, my brother,With this message to Imoski's Cadi:'The young widow sends thee friendly greeting;Earnestly she prays thee, through this letter,That, when thou com'st hither, with thy Suatians,A long veil thou'lt bring me, 'neath whose shadowI may hide, when near the house of Asan,And not see my dearly cherish'd orphans.'"

모모Scarcely had the Cadi read this letter,Than he gather'd all his Suatians round him,And then tow'rd the bride his course directed,And the veil she ask'd for, took he with him.

모모Happily they reach'd the princess' dwelling,From the dwelling happily they led her.But when they approach'd the house of Asan,Lo! the children saw from high their mother,And they shouted: "To thy halls return thou!Eat thy supper with thy darling children!"Mournfully the wife of Asan heard it,Tow'rd the Suatian prince then turn'd she, saying:"Let, I pray, the Suatians and the horsesAt the loved ones' door a short time tarry,That I may give presents to my children."

모모And before the loved ones' door they tarried,And she presents gave to her poor children,To the boys gave gold-embroider'd buskins,To the girls gave long and costly dresses,To the suckling, helpless in the cradle,Gave a garment, to be worn hereafter.

모모This aside saw Father Asan Aga,--Sadly cried he to his darling children:"Hither come, ye dear unhappy infants,For your mother's breast is turn'd to iron,Lock'd for ever, closed to all compassion!"

모모When the wife of Asan heard him speak thus,On the ground, all pale and trembling, fell she,And her spirit fled her sorrowing bosom,When she saw her children flying from her.

모모CANTATAS.

모모-----May the bard these numbers praise,That are sung his fame to raise.-----

모모THE Poems composed by Goethe under this title are five innumber, of which three are here given. The other two are entirelypersonal in their allusions, and not of general interest. One ofthem is a Requiem on the Prince de Ligne, who died in 1814, andwhom Goethe calls "the happiest man of the century," and theother was composed in honour of the 70th birthday of his friendZelter the composer, when Goethe was himself more than 79 (1828).The following sweet aria introduced in the latter is, however,worth giving:--

모모THE flowers so carefully rear'd,

모모In a garland for him I oft twin'd:How sweet have they ever appear'd,

모모When wreath'd for a friend dear and kind.Then incense sweet ascended,

모모Then new-horn blossoms rose,With gentle zephyrs blended

모모In tones of soft repose.-----IDYLL.

모모A village Chorus is supposed to be assembled, and about tocommence its festive procession.

모모[Written for the birthday of the Duchess Louisa of Weimar.]

모모CHORUS.

모모THE festal day hail ye

모모With garlands of pleasure,

모모And dances' soft measure,With rapture commingledAnd sweet choral song.

모모DAMON.

모모Oh, how I yearn from out the crowd to flee!What joy a secret glade would give to me!Amid the throng, the turmoil here,Confined the plain, the breezes e'en appear.

모모CHORUS.

모모Now order it truly,That ev'ry one dulyMay roam and may wander,Now here, and now yonder,

모모The meadows along.

모모[The Chorus retreats gradually, and the song becomes fainter andfainter, till it dies away in the distance.]

모모DAMON.

모모In vain ye call, in vain would lure me on;True my heart speaks,--but with itself alone.

모모And if I may view

모모A blessing-fraught land,

모모The heaven's clear blue,

모모And the plain's verdant hue,

모모Alone I'll rejoice,

모모Undisturbed by man's voice.

모모And there I'll pay homage

모모To womanly merit,

모모Observe it in spirit,

모모In spirit pay homage;

모모To echo alone

모모Shall my secret be known.

모모CHORUS.

모모[Faintly mingling with Damon's song in the distance.]

모모To echo--alone--

모모Shall my secret--be known.--

모모MENALCAS.

모모My friend, why meet I here with thee?

모모Thou hast'nest not to join the festal throng?No longer stay, but come with me,

모모And mingle in the dance and song.

모모DAMON.

모모Thou'rt welcome, friend! but suffer me to roam

모모Where these old beeches hide me from man's view:Love seeks in solitude a home,

모모And homage may retreat there too.

모모MENALCAS.

모모Thou seekest here a spurious fame,

모모And hast a mind to-day to grieve me.Love as thy portion thou mayst claim

모모But homage thou must share with all, believe me!

모모When their voices thousands raise,And the dawn of morning praise,

모모Rapture bringing,

모모Blithely singing

모모On before us,Heart and ear in pleasure vie;

모모And when thousands join in chorus,

모모With the feelings brightly glowing,

모모And the wishes overflowing,Forcibly they'll bear thee high.

모모[The Chorus gradually approaches, from the distance.]

모모DAMON.

모모Distant strains are hither wending,

모모And I'm gladden'd by the throng;Yes, they're coming,--yes, descending

모모To the valley from the height,

모모MENALCAS.

모모Let us haste, our footsteps blending

모모With the rhythm of the song!Yes, they come; their course they're bending

모모Tow'rd the wood's green sward so bright.

모모CHORUS.[Gradually becoming louder.]

모모Yes, we hither come, attending

모모With the harmony of song,As the hours their race are ending

모모On this day of blest delight.

모모ALL.

모모Let none revealThe thoughts we feel,The aims we own!Let joy alone

모모Disclose the story!She'll prove it rightAnd her delight

모모Includes the glory,Includes the blissOf days like this!

모모1813.-----RINALDO.*

모모[This Cantata was written for Prince Frederick of Gotha, and setto music by Winter, the Prince singing the part of Rinaldo.--Seethe Annalen.]

모모(* See Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata, Canto XVI.)

모모CHORUS.

모모To the strand! quick, mount the bark!

모모If no favouring zephyrs blow,

모모Ply the oar and nimbly row,And with zeal your prowess mark!

모모O'er the sea we thus career.

모모RINALDO.

모모Oh, let me linger one short moment here!'Tis heaven's decree, I may not hence away.The rugged cliffs, the wood-encircled bay,Hold me a prisoner, and my flight delay.

모모Ye were so fair, but now that dream is o'er;The charms of earth, the charms of heaven are nought.What keeps me in this spot so terror-fraught?

모모My only joy is fled for evermore.

모모Let me taste those days so sweet,

모모Heav'n-descended, once again!Heart, dear heart! ay, warmly beat!

모모Spirit true, recall those days

모모Freeborn breath thy gentle lays

모모Mingled are with joy and pain.

모모Round the beds, so richly gleaming,

모모Rises up a palace fair;All with rosy fragrance teeming,

모모As in dream thou saw'st it ne'er.

모모And this spacious garden round,

모모Far extend the galleries;Roses blossom near the ground,

모모High in air, too, bloom the trees.

모모Wat'ry flakes and jets are falling.

모모Sweet and silv'ry strains arise;While the turtle-dove is calling,

모모And the nightingale replies.

모모CHORUS.

모모Gently come! feel no alarm,

모모On a noble duty bent;Vanish'd now is ev'ry charm

모모That by magic power was lent.Friendly words and greetings calmOn his wounds will pour soft balm.

모모Fill his mind with sweet content.

모모RINALDO.

모모Hark! the turtle-dove is calling,

모모And the nightingale replies;Wat'ry flakes and jets are falling,

모모Mingling with their melodies.

모모But all of them say:

모모Her only we mean;But all fly away,

모모As soon as she's seen,--The beauteous young maiden,

모모With graces so rife,

모모Then lily and rose

모모In wreaths are entwining;

모모In dancing combining,Each zephyr that blows

모모Its brother is greeting,

모모All flying and meeting,With balsam full laden,

모모When waken'd to life.

모모CHORUS.

모모No! no longer may we wait;Rouse him from his vision straight!Show the adamantine shield!

모모RINALDO.

모모Woe! what form is here reveal'd!

모모CHORUS.

모모'Twill disclose the cheat to thee.

모모RINALDO.

모모Am I doom'd myself to seeThus degraded evermore?

모모CHORUS.

모모Courage take, and all is o'er.

모모RINALDO.

모모Be it so! I'll take fresh heart,From the spot beloved depart,Leave Armida once again,--Come then! here no more remain.

모모CHORUS.

모모Yes, 'tis well! no more remain.

모모SEMI-CHORUS.

모모Away then! let's fly

모모O'er the zephyr-kiss'd ocean!The soul-lighted eye

모모Sees armies in motion,See proud banners wave

모모O'er the dust-sprinkled course.

모모CHORUS.

모모From his forefathers brave

모모Draws the hero new force.

모모RINALDO.

모모With sorrow laden,

모모Within this valley's

모모All-silent alleysThe fairest maiden

모모Again I see.

모모Twice can this be?What! shall I hear it,And not have spiritTo ease her pains?

모모CHORUS.

모모Unworthy chains?

모모RINALDO.

모모And now I've see her,

모모Alas! how changed!With cold demeanour.

모모And looks estranged,With ghostly tread,--All hope is fled,Yes, fled for ever.The lightnings quiver,Each palace falls;The godlike halls,Each joyous hourOf spirit-power,With love's sweet dayAll fade away!

모모CHORUS.

모모Yes, fade away!

모모SEMI-CHORUS.

모모Already are heard

모모The prayers of the pious.

모모Why longer deny us?The favouring zephyr

모모Forbids all delay.

모모CHORUS.

모모Away, then! away!

모모RINALDO.

모모With heart sadly stirr'd,

모모Your command I receive;

모모Ye force me to leave.Unkind is the zephyr,--

모모Oh, wherefore not stay?

모모CHORUS.

모모Away, then! away!

모모1811.-----THE FIRST WALPURGIS-NIGHT.

모모A DRUID.

모모SWEET smiles the May!

모모The forest gay

모모From frost and ice is freed;

모모No snow is found,

모모Glad songs resound

모모Across the verdant mead.

모모Upon the height

모모The snow lies light,

모모Yet thither now we go,There to extol our Father's name,

모모Whom we for ages know.Amid the smoke shall gleam the flame;

모모Thus pure the heart will grow.

모모THE DRUIDS.

모모Amid the smoke shall gleam the flame;Extol we now our Father's name,

모모Whom we for ages know!

모모Up, up, then, let us go!

모모ONE OF THE PEOPLE.

모모Would ye, then, so rashly act?Would ye instant death attract?Know ye not the cruel threats

모모Of the victors we obey?Round about are placed their nets

모모In the sinful heathen's way.Ah! upon the lofty wall

모모Wife and children slaughter they;And we allHasten to a certain fall.

모모CHORUS OF WOMEN.

모모Ay, upon the camp's high wall

모모All our children loved they slay.

모모Ah, what cruel victors they!And we allHasten to a certain fall.

모모A DRUID.

모모Who fears to-day

모모His rites to pay,

모모Deserves his chains to wear.

모모The forest's free!

모모This wood take we,

모모And straight a pile prepare!

모모Yet in the wood

모모To stay 'tis good

모모By day, till all is still,With watchers all around us plac'd

모모Protecting you from ill.With courage fresh, then let us haste

모모Our duties to fulfil.

모모CHORUS OF WATCHERS.

모모Ye valiant watchers, now divideYour numbers through the forest wide,

모모And see that all is still,

모모While they their rites fulfil.

모모A WATCHER.

모모Let us in a cunning wise,Yon dull Christian priests surpriseWith the devil of their talk

모모We'll those very priests confound.Come with prong, and come with fork.

모모Raise a wild and rattling soundThrough the livelong night, and prowl

모모All the rocky passes round.Screechowl, owl,Join in chorus with our howl!

모모CHORUS OF WATCHERS.

모모Come with prong, and come with fork,Like the devil of their talk,And with wildly rattling sound,Prowl the desert rocks around!Screechowl, owl,Join in chorus with our howl!

모모A DRUID.

모모Thus far 'tis right.

모모That we by night

모모Our Father's praises sing;

모모Yet when 'tis day,

모모To Thee we may

모모A heart unsullied bring.

모모'Tis true that now,

모모And often, Thou

모모Fav'rest the foe in fight.As from the smoke is freed the blaze,

모모So let our faith burn bright!And if they crush our golden ways,

모모Who e'er can crush Thy light?

모모A CHRISTIAN WATCHER.

모모Comrades, quick! your aid afford!All the brood of hell's abroad;See how their enchanted forms

모모Through and through with flames are glowing!Dragon-women, men-wolf swarms,

모모On in quick succession going!Let us, let us haste to fly!

모모Wilder yet the sounds are growing,And the archfiend roars on high;From the groundHellish vapours rise around.

모모CHORUS OF CHRISTIAN WATCHERS.

모모Terrible enchanted forms,Dragon-women, men-wolf swarms!Wilder yet the sounds are growing!See, the archfiend comes, all-glowing!From the groundHellish vapours rise around!

모모CHORUS OF DRUIDS.

모모As from the smoke is freed the blaze,

모모So let our faith burn bright!And if they crush our golden ways,

모모Who e'er can crush Thy light?

모모1799.-----

모모ODES.

모모-----

모모THESE are the most singular of all the Poems of Goethe, and tomany will appear so wild and fantastic, as to leave anything buta pleasing impression. Those at the beginning, addressed to hisfriend Behrisch, were written at the age of eighteen, and most ofthe remainder were composed while he was still quite young.Despite, however, the extravagance of some of them, such as theWinter Journey over the Hartz Mountains, and the Wanderer'sStorm-Song, nothing can be finer than the noble one entitledMahomet's Song, and others, such as the Spirit Song' over theWaters, The God-like, and, above all, the magnificent sketch ofPrometheus, which forms part of an unfinished piece bearing thesame name, and called by Goethe a 'Dramatic Fragment.'

모모TO MY FRIEND.

모모[These three Odes are addressed to a certain Behrisch, who wastutor to Count Lindenau, and of whom Goethe gives an odd accountat the end of the Seventh Book of his Autobiography.]

모모FIRST ODE.

모모TRANSPLANT the beauteous tree!Gardener, it gives me pain;A happier resting-placeIts trunk deserved.

모모Yet the strength of its natureTo Earth's exhausting avarice,To Air's destructive inroads,An antidote opposed.

모모See how it in springtimeCoins its pale green leaves!Their orange-fragrancePoisons each flyblow straight.

모모The caterpillar's toothIs blunted by them;With silv'ry hues they gleamIn the bright sunshine,

모모Its twigs the maidenFain would twine inHer bridal-garland;Youths its fruit are seeking.

모모See, the autumn cometh!The caterpillarSighs to the crafty spider,--Sighs that the tree will not fade.

모모Hov'ring thitherFrom out her yew-tree dwelling,The gaudy foe advancesAgainst the kindly tree,

모모And cannot hurt it,But the more artful oneDefiles with nauseous venomIts silver leaves;

모모And sees with triumphHow the maiden shudders,The youth, how mourns he,On passing by.

모모Transplant the beauteous tree!Gardener, it gives me pain;Tree, thank the gardenerWho moves thee hence!

모모1767.-----SECOND ODE.

모모THOU go'st! I murmur--Go! let me murmur.Oh, worthy man,Fly from this land!

모모Deadly marshes,Steaming mists of OctoberHere interweave their currents,Blending for ever.

모모Noisome insectsHere are engender'd;Fatal darknessVeils their malice.

모모The fiery-tongued serpent,Hard by the sedgy bank,Stretches his pamper'd body,Caress'd by the sun's bright beams.

모모Tempt no gentle night-ramblesUnder the moon's cold twilight!Loathsome toads hold their meetingsYonder at every crossway.

모모Injuring not,Fear will they cause thee.Oh, worthy man,Fly from this land!

모모1767.-----THIRD ODE.

모모BE void of feeling!A heart that soon is stirr'd,Is a possession sadUpon this changing earth.

모모Behrisch, let spring's sweet smileNever gladden thy brow!Then winter's gloomy tempestsNever will shadow it o'er.

모모Lean thyself ne'er on a maiden'sSorrow-engendering breast.Ne'er on the arm,Misery-fraught, of a friend.

모모Already envyFrom out his rocky ambushUpon thee turnsThe force of his lynx-like eyes,

모모Stretches his talons,On thee falls,In thy shouldersCunningly plants them.

모모Strong are his skinny arms,As panther-claws;He shaketh thee,And rends thy frame.

모모Death 'tis to part,'Tis threefold deathTo part, not hopingEver to meet again.

모모Thou wouldst rejoice to leaveThis hated land behind,Wert thou not chain'd to meWith friendships flowery chains.

모모Burst them! I'll not repine.No noble friendWould stay his fellow-captive,If means of flight appear.

모모The remembranceOf his dear friend's freedomGives him freedomIn his dungeon.

모모Thou go'st,--I'm left.But e'en alreadyThe last year's winged spokesWhirl round the smoking axle.

모모I number the turnsOf the thundering wheel;The last one I bless.--Each bar then is broken, I'm free then as thou!

모모1767.-----MAHOMET'S SONG.

모모[This song was intended to be introduced in a dramatic poementitled Mahomet, the plan of which was not carried out byGoethe. He mentions that it was to have been sung by Ali towardsthe end of the piece, in honor of his master, Mahomet, shortlybefore his death, and when at the height of his glory, of whichit is typical.]

모모SEE the rock-born stream!Like the gleamOf a star so brightKindly spiritsHigh above the cloudsNourished him while youthfulIn the copse between the cliffs.

모모Young and fresh.From the clouds he dancethDown upon the marble rocks;Then tow'rd heavenLeaps exulting.

모모Through the mountain-passesChaseth he the colour'd pebbles,And, advancing like a chief,Tears his brother streamlets with himIn his course.

모모In the valley down below'Neath his footsteps spring the flowers,And the meadowIn his breath finds life.

모모Yet no shady vale can stay him,Nor can flowers,Round his knees all-softly twiningWith their loving eyes detain him;To the plain his course he taketh,Serpent-winding,

모모Social streamletsJoin his waters. And now moves heO'er the plain in silv'ry glory,And the plain in him exults,And the rivers from the plain,And the streamlets from the mountain,Shout with joy, exclaiming: "Brother,Brother, take thy brethren with thee,With thee to thine aged father,To the everlasting ocean,Who, with arms outstretching far,Waiteth for us;Ah, in vain those arms lie openTo embrace his yearning children;For the thirsty sand consumes usIn the desert waste; the sunbeamsDrink our life-blood; hills around usInto lakes would dam us! Brother,Take thy brethren of the plain,Take thy brethren of the mountainWith thee, to thy father's arms!

모모Let all come, then!--And now swells heLordlier still; yea, e'en a peopleBears his regal flood on high!And in triumph onward rolling,Names to countries gives he,--citiesSpring to light beneath his foot.

모모Ever, ever, on he rushes,Leaves the towers' flame-tipp'd summits,Marble palaces, the offspringOf his fullness, far behind.

모모Cedar-houses bears the AtlasOn his giant shoulders; flutt'ringIn the breeze far, far above himThousand flags are gaily floating,Bearing witness to his might.

모모And so beareth he his brethren,All his treasures, all his children,Wildly shouting, to the bosomOf his long-expectant sire.

모모1774.-----SPIRIT SONG OVER THE WATERS.

모모THE soul of manResembleth water:From heaven it cometh,To heaven it soareth.And then againTo earth descendeth,Changing ever.

모모Down from the loftyRocky wallStreams the bright flood,Then spreadeth gentlyIn cloudy billowsO'er the smooth rock,And welcomed kindly,Veiling, on roams it,Soft murmuring,Tow'rd the abyss.

모모Cliffs projectingOppose its progress,--Angrily foams itDown to the bottom,Step by step.

모모Now, in flat channel,Through the meadowland steals it,And in the polish'd lakeEach constellationJoyously peepeth.

모모Wind is the lovingWooer of waters;Wind blends togetherBillows all-foaming.

모모Spirit of man,Thou art like unto water!Fortune of man,Thou art like unto wind!

모모1789.*-----MY GODDESS.

모모SAY, which ImmortalMerits the highest reward?With none contend I,But I will give itTo the aye-changing,Ever-movingWondrous daughter of Jove.His best-beloved offspring.Sweet Phantasy.

모모For unto herHath he grantedAll the fancies which erstTo none allow'd heSaving himself;Now he takes his pleasureIn the mad one.

모모She may, crowned with roses,With staff twined round with lilies,Roam thro' flow'ry valleys,Rule the butterfly-people,And soft-nourishing dewWith bee-like lipsDrink from the blossom:

모모Or else she mayWith fluttering hairAnd gloomy looksSigh in the windRound rocky cliffs,And thousand-hued.Like morn and even.Ever changing,Like moonbeam's light,To mortals appear.

모모Let us all, then,Adore the Father!The old, the mighty,Who such a beauteousNe'er-fading spouseDeigns to accordTo perishing mortals!

모모To us aloneDoth he unite her,With heavenly bonds,While he commands her,in joy and sorrow,As a true spouseNever to fly us.

모모All the remainingRaces so poorOf life-teeming earth.In children so rich.Wander and feedIn vacant enjoyment,And 'mid the dark sorrowsOf evanescentRestricted life,--Bow'd by the heavyYoke of Necessity.

모모But unto us heHath his most versatile,Most cherished daughterGranted,--what joy!

모모Lovingly greet herAs a beloved one!Give her the woman'sPlace in our home!

모모And oh, may the agedStepmother WisdomHer gentle spiritNe'er seek to harm!

모모Yet know I her sister,The older, sedater,Mine own silent friend;Oh, may she never,Till life's lamp is quench'd,Turn away from me,--That noble inciter,Comforter,--Hope!

모모1781.-----WINTER JOURNEY OVER THE HARTZ MOUNTAINS.

모모[The following explanation is necessary, in order to make thisode in any way intelligible. The Poet is supposed to leave hiscompanions, who are proceeding on a hunting expedition in winter,in order himself to pay a visit to a hypochondriacal friend, andalso to see the mining in the Hartz mountains. The odealternately describes, in a very fragmentary and peculiar manner,the naturally happy disposition of the Poet himself and theunhappiness of his friend; it pictures the wildness of the roadand the dreariness of the prospect, which is relieved at one spotby the distant sight of a town, a very vague allusion to which ismade in the third strophe; it recalls the hunting party on whichhis companions have gone; and after an address to Love, concludesby a contrast between the unexplored recesses of the highest peakof the Hartz and the metalliferous veins of its smallerbrethren.]

모모LIKE the vultureWho on heavy morning cloudsWith gentle wing reposingLooks for his prey,--Hover, my song!

모모For a God hathUnto each prescribedHis destined path,Which the happy oneRuns o'er swiftlyTo his glad goal:He whose heart cruelFate hath contracted,Struggles but vainlyAgainst all the barriersThe brazen thread raises,But which the harsh shearsMust one day sever.

모모Through gloomy thicketsPresseth the wild deer on,And with the sparrowsLong have the wealthySettled themselves in the marsh.

모모Easy 'tis following the chariotThat by Fortune is driven,Like the baggage that movesOver well-mended highwaysAfter the train of a prince.

모모But who stands there apart?In the thicket, lost is his path;Behind him the bushesAre closing together,The grass springs up again,The desert engulphs him.

모모Ah, who'll heal his afflictions,To whom balsam was poison,Who, from love's fullness,Drank in misanthropy only?First despised, and now a despiser,He, in secret, wastethAll that he is worth,In a selfishness vain.If there be, on thy psaltery,Father of Love, but one toneThat to his ear may be pleasing,Oh, then, quicken his heart!Clear his cloud-enveloped eyesOver the thousand fountainsClose by the thirsty oneIn the desert.

모모Thou who createst much joy,For each a measure o'erflowing,Bless the sons of the chaseWhen on the track of the prey,With a wild thirsting for blood,Youthful and joyousAvenging late the injusticeWhich the peasant resistedVainly for years with his staff.

모모But the lonely one veilWithin thy gold clouds!Surround with winter-green,Until the roses bloom again,The humid locks,Oh Love, of thy minstrel!

모모With thy glimmering torchLightest thou himThrough the fords when 'tis night,Over bottomless placesOn desert-like plains;With the thousand colours of morningGladd'nest his bosom;With the fierce-biting stormBearest him proudly on high;Winter torrents rush from the cliffs,--Blend with his psalms;An altar of grateful delightHe finds in the much-dreaded mountain'sSnow-begirded summit,Which foreboding nationsCrown'd with spirit-dances.

모모Thou stand'st with breast inscrutable,Mysteriously disclosed,High o'er the wondering world,And look'st from cloudsUpon its realms and its majesty,Which thou from the veins of thy brethrenNear thee dost water.

모모1777.-----TO FATHER* KRONOS.

모모[written in a post-chaise.]

모모(* In the original, Schwager, which has the twofold meaning ofbrother-in-law and postilion.)

모모HASTEN thee, Kronos!On with clattering trotDownhill goeth thy path;Loathsome dizziness ever,When thou delayest, assails me.Quick, rattle along,Over stock and stone let thy trotInto life straightway lead

모모Now once moreUp the toilsome ascentHasten, panting for breath!Up, then, nor idle be,--Striving and hoping, up, up!

모모Wide, high, glorious the viewGazing round upon life,While from mount unto mountHovers the spirit eterne,Life eternal foreboding.

모모Sideways a roof's pleasant shadeAttracts thee,And a look that promises coolnessOn the maidenly threshold.There refresh thee! And, maiden,Give me this foaming draught also,Give me this health-laden look!

모모Down, now! quicker still, down!See where the sun setsEre he sets, ere old ageSeizeth me in the morass,Ere my toothless jaws mumble,And my useless limbs totter;While drunk with his farewell beamHurl me,--a fiery seaFoaming still in mine eye,--Hurl me, while dazzled and reeling,Down to the gloomy portal of hell.

모모Blow, then, gossip, thy horn,Speed on with echoing trot,So that Orcus may know we are coming;So that our host may with joyWait at the door to receive us.

모모1774.-----THE WANDERER'S STORM-SONG.

모모[Goethe says of this ode, that it is the only one remaining outof several strange hymns and dithyrambs composed by him at aperiod of great unhappiness, when the love-affair between him andFrederica had been broken off by him. He used to sing them whilewandering wildly about the country. This particular one wascaused by his being caught in a tremendous storm on one of theseoccasions. He calls it a half-crazy piece (halkunsinn), and thereader will probably agree with him.]

모모He whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Feels no dread within his heartAt the tempest or the rain.He whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Will to the rain-clouds,Will to the hailstorm,Sing in replyAs the lark sings,Oh thou on high!

모모Him whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt raise above the mud-trackWith thy fiery pinions.He will wander,As, with flowery feet,Over Deucalion's dark flood,Python-slaying, light, glorious,Pythius Apollo.

모모Him whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt place upon thy fleecy pinionWhen he sleepeth on the rock,--Thou wilt shelter with thy guardian wingIn the forest's midnight hour.

모모Him whom thou ne'er leavest, Genius,Thou wilt wrap up warmlyIn the snow-drift;Tow'rd the warmth approach the Muses,Tow'rd the warmth approach the Graces.

모모Ye Muses, hover round me!Ye Graces also!That is water, that is earth,And the son of water and of earthOver which I wander,Like the gods.

모모Ye are pure, like the heart of the water,Ye are pure like the marrow of earth,Hov'ring round me, while I hoverOver water, o'er the earthLike the gods.

모모Shall he, then, return,The small, the dark, the fiery peasant?Shall he, then, return, waitingOnly thy gifts, oh Father Bromius,And brightly gleaming, warmth-spreading fire?Return with joy?And I, whom ye attended,Ye Muses and ye Graces,Whom all awaits that ye,Ye Muses and ye Graces,Of circling bliss in lifeHave glorified--shall IReturn dejected?

모모Father Bromius!Thourt the Genius,Genius of ages,Thou'rt what inward glowTo Pindar was,What to the worldPhoebus Apollo.

모모Woe! Woe Inward warmth,Spirit-warmth,Central-point!Glow, and vie withPhoebus Apollo!Coldly soonHis regal lookOver thee will swiftly glide,--

모모Envy-struckLinger o'er the cedar's strength,Which, to flourish,Waits him not.

모모Why doth my lay name thee the last?Thee, from whom it began,Thee, in whom it endeth,Thee, from whom it flows,Jupiter Pluvius!Tow'rd thee streams my song.And a Castalian springRuns as a fellow-brook,Runs to the idle ones,Mortal, happy ones,Apart from thee,Who cov'rest me around,Jupiter Pluvius!

모모Not by the elm-treeHim didst thou visit,With the pair of dovesHeld in his gentle arm,--With the beauteous garland of roses,--Caressing him, so blest in his flowers,Anacreon,Storm-breathing godhead!Not in the poplar grove,Near the Sybaris' strand,Not on the mountain'sSun-illumined browDidst thou seize him,The flower-singing,Honey-breathing,Sweetly noddingTheocritus.

모모When the wheels were rattling,Wheel on wheel tow'rd the goal,High aroseThe sound of the lashOf youths with victory glowing,In the dust rolling,As from the mountain fallShowers of stones in the vale--Then thy soul was brightly glowing, Pindar--Glowing? Poor heart!

모모There, on the hill,--Heavenly might!But enough glowThither to wend,Where is my cot!

모모1771.-----THE SEA-VOYAGE.

모모MANY a day and night my bark stood ready laden;Waiting fav'ring winds, I sat with true friends round me,Pledging me to patience and to courage,In the haven.

모모And they spoke thus with impatience twofold:"Gladly pray we for thy rapid passage,Gladly for thy happy voyage; fortuneIn the distant world is waiting for thee,In our arms thoult find thy prize, and love too,When returning."

모모And when morning came, arose an uproar,And the sailors' joyous shouts awoke us;All was stirring, all was living, moving,Bent on sailing with the first kind zephyr.

모모And the sails soon in the breeze are swelling,And the sun with fiery love invites us;Fill'd the sails are, clouds on high are floating,On the shore each friend exulting raisesSongs of hope, in giddy joy expectingJoy the voyage through, as on the morn of sailing,And the earliest starry nights so radiant.

모모But by God-sent changing winds ere long he's drivenSideways from the course he had intended,And he feigns as though he would surrender,While he gently striveth to outwit them,

모모To his goal, e'en when thus press'd, still faithful.But from out the damp grey distance rising,Softly now the storm proclaims its advent,Presseth down each bird upon the waters,Presseth down the throbbing hearts of mortals.And it cometh. At its stubborn fury,Wisely ev'ry sail the seaman striketh;With the anguish-laden ball are sportingWind and water.

모모And on yonder shore are gather'd standing,Friends and lovers, trembling for the bold one:"Why, alas, remain'd he here not with us!Ah, the tempest! Cast away by fortune!Must the good one perish in this fashion?Might not he perchance.... Ye great immortals!"

모모Yet he, like a man, stands by his rudder;With the bark are sporting wind and water,Wind and water sport not with his bosom:On the fierce deep looks he, as a master,--In his gods, or shipwreck'd, or safe landed,Trusting ever.

모모1776.-----THE EAGLE AND DOVE.

모모IN search of prey once raised his pinionsAn eaglet;A huntsman's arrow came, and reftHis right wing of all motive power.Headlong he fell into a myrtle grove,For three long days on anguish fed,In torment writhedThroughout three long, three weary nights;And then was cured,Thanks to all-healing Nature'sSoft, omnipresent balm.He crept away from out the copse,And stretch'd his wing--alas!Lost is all power of flight--He scarce can lift himselfFrom off the groundTo catch some mean, unworthy prey,And rests, deep-sorrowing,On the low rock beside the stream.Up to the oak he looks,Looks up to heaven,While in his noble eye there gleams a tear.Then, rustling through the myrtle boughs, behold,There comes a wanton pair of doves,Who settle down, and, nodding, strutO'er the gold sands beside the stream,And gradually approach;Their red-tinged eyes, so full of love,Soon see the inward-sorrowing one.The male, inquisitively social, leapsOn the next bush, and looksUpon him kindly and complacently."Thou sorrowest," murmurs he:"Be of good cheer, my friend!All that is needed for calm happinessHast thou not here?Hast thou not pleasure in the golden boughThat shields thee from the day's fierce glow?Canst thou not raise thy breast to catch,On the soft moss beside the brook,The sun's last rays at even?Here thou mayst wander through the flowers' fresh dew,Pluck from the overflowThe forest-trees provide,Thy choicest food,--mayst quenchThy light thirst at the silvery spring.Oh friend, true happinessLies in contentedness,And that contentednessFinds everywhere enough.""Oh, wise one!" said the eagle, while he sankIn deep and ever deep'ning thought--"Oh Wisdom! like a dove thou speakest!"

모모1774.*-----PROMETHEUS.

모모COVER thy spacious heavens, Zeus,With clouds of mist,And, like the boy who lopsThe thistles' heads,Disport with oaks and mountain-peaks,Yet thou must leaveMy earth still standing;My cottage too, which was not raised by thee;Leave me my hearth,Whose kindly glowBy thee is envied.

모모I know nought poorerUnder the sun, than ye gods!Ye nourish painfully,With sacrificesAnd votive prayers,Your majesty:Ye would e'en starve,If children and beggarsWere not trusting fools.

모모While yet a childAnd ignorant of life,I turned my wandering gazeUp tow'rd the sun, as if with himThere were an ear to hear my wailings,A heart, like mine,To feel compassion for distress.

모모Who help'd meAgainst the Titans' insolence?Who rescued me from certain death,From slavery?Didst thou not do all this thyself,My sacred glowing heart?And glowedst, young and good,Deceived with grateful thanksTo yonder slumbering one?

모모I honour thee! and why?Hast thou e'er lighten'd the sorrowsOf the heavy laden?Hast thou e'er dried up the tearsOf the anguish-stricken?Was I not fashion'd to be a manBy omnipotent Time,And by eternal Fate,Masters of me and thee?

모모Didst thou e'er fancyThat life I should learn to hate,And fly to deserts,Because not allMy blossoming dreams grew ripe?

모모Here sit I, forming mortalsAfter my image;A race resembling me,To suffer, to weep,To enjoy, to be glad,And thee to scorn,As I!

모모1773.-----GANYMEDE.

모모How, in the light of morning,Round me thou glowest,Spring, thou beloved one!With thousand-varying loving blissThe sacred emotionsBorn of thy warmth eternalPress 'gainst my bosom,Thou endlessly fair one!Could I but hold thee clasp'dWithin mine arms!

모모Ah! upon thy bosomLay I, pining,And then thy flowers, thy grass,Were pressing against my heart.Thou coolest the burningThirst of my bosom,Beauteous morning breeze!The nightingale then calls meSweetly from out of the misty vale.I come, I come!Whither? Ah, whither?

모모Up, up, lies my course.While downward the cloudsAre hovering, the cloudsAre bending to meet yearning love.For me,Within thine armsUpwards!Embraced and embracing!Upwards into thy bosom,Oh Father all-loving!

모모1789.*-----THE BOUNDARIES OF HUMANITY.

모모WHEN the primevalAll-holy FatherSows with a tranquil handFrom clouds, as they roll,Bliss-spreading lightningsOver the earth,Then do I kiss the lastHem of his garment,While by a childlike aweFiil'd is my breast.

모모For with immortalsNe'er may a mortalMeasure himself.If he soar upwardsAnd if he touchWith his forehead the stars,Nowhere will rest thenHis insecure feet,And with him sportTempest and cloud.

모모Though with firm sinewyLimbs he may standOn the enduringWell-grounded earth,All he is everAble to do,Is to resembleThe oak or the vine.

모모Wherein do godsDiffer from mortals?In that the formerSee endless billowsHeaving before them;Us doth the billowLift up and swallow,So that we perish.

모모Small is the ringEnclosing our life,And whole generationsLink themselves firmlyOn to existence'sChain never-ending.

모모1789. *-----THE GODLIKE.

모모NOBLE be man,Helpful and good!For that aloneDistinguisheth himFrom all the beingsUnto us known.

모모Hail to the beings,Unknown and glorious,Whom we forebode!From his exampleLearn we to know them!

모모For unfeelingNature is ever:On bad and on goodThe sun alike shineth;And on the wicked,As on the best,The moon and stars gleam.

모모Tempest and torrent,Thunder and hail,Roar on their path,Seizing the while,As they haste onward,One after another.

모모Even so, fortuneGropes 'mid the throng--Innocent boyhood'sCurly head seizing,--Seizing the hoaryHead of the sinner.

모모After laws mighty,Brazen, eternal,Must all we mortalsFinish the circuitOf our existence.

모모Man, and man onlyCan do the impossible;He 'tis distinguisheth,Chooseth and judgeth;He to the momentEndurance can lend.

모모He and he onlyThe good can reward,The bad can he punish,Can heal and can save;All that wanders and straysCan usefully blend.And we pay homageTo the immortalsAs though they were men,And did in the great,What the best, in the small,Does or might do.

모모Be the man that is noble,Both helpful and good.Unweariedly formingThe right and the useful,A type of those beingsOur mind hath foreshadow'd!

모모MISCELLANEOUS POEMS.

모모-----in the wares before you spread,Types of all things may be read.-----THE GERMAN PARNASSUS.

모모'NEATH the shadow

모모Of these bushes,On the meadow

모모Where the cooling water gushes.Phoebus gave me, when a boy,All life's fullness to enjoy.So, in silence, as the GodBade them with his sov'reign nod,Sacred Muses train'd my daysTo his praise.--With the bright and silv'ry floodOf Parnassus stirr'd my blood,And the seal so pure and chasteBy them on my lips was placed.

모모With her modest pinions, see,Philomel encircles me!In these bushes, in yon grove,

모모Calls she to her sister-throng,

모모And their heavenly choral songTeaches me to dream of love.

모모Fullness waxes in my breastOf emotions social, blest;Friendship's nurtured칿ove awakes,--And the silence Phoebus breaksOf his mountains, of his vales,Sweetly blow the balmy gales;All for whom he shows affection,Who are worthy his protection,Gladly follow his direction.

모모This one comes with joyous bearing

모모And with open, radiant gaze;That a sterner look is wearing,This one, scarcely cured, with daring

모모Wakes the strength of former days;For the sweet, destructive flamePierced his marrow and his frame.That which Amor stole beforePhoebus only can restore,Peace, and joy, and harmony,Aspirations pure and free.

모모Brethren, rise ye!Numbers prize ye!Deeds of worth resemble they.

모모Who can better than the bardGuide a friend when gone astray?

모모If his duty he regard,More he'll do, than others may.

모모Yes! afar I hear them sing!Yes! I hear them touch the string,And with mighty godlike stroke

모모Right and duty they inspire,And evoke,

모모As they sing, and wake the lyre,Tendencies of noblest worth,To each type of strength give birth.

모모Phantasies of sweetest powerFlowerRound about on ev'ry bough,Bending nowLike the magic wood of old,'Neath the fruit that gleams like gold.

모모What we feel and what we view

모모In the land of highest bliss,--

모모This dear soil, a sun like this,--Lures the best of women too.And the Muses' breathings blestRouse the maiden's gentle breast,Tune the throat to minstrelsy,And with cheeks of beauteous dye,Bid it sing a worthy song,Sit the sister-band among;And their strains grow softer still,As they vie with earnest will.

모모One amongst the band betimes

모모Goes to wanderBy the beeches, 'neath the limes,

모모Yonder seeking, finding yonderThat which in the morning-groveShe had lost through roguish Love,All her breast's first aspirations,And her heart's calm meditations,To the shady wood so fair

모모Gently stealing,Takes she that which man can ne'er

모모Duly merit,--each soft feeling,--Disregards the noontide rayAnd the dew at close of day,?

모모In the plain her path she loses.Ne'er disturb her on her way!

모모Seek her silently, ye Muses

모모Shouts I hear, wherein the soundOf the waterfall is drown'd.From the grove loud clamours rise,Strange the tumult, strange the cries.See I rightly? Can it be?To the very sanctuary,Lo, an impious troop in-hies!

모모O'er the landStreams the band;Hot desire,Drunken-fireIn their gazeWildly plays,--Makes their hairBristle there.And the troop,With fell swoop,Women, men,Coming then,Ply their blowsAnd expose,Void of shame,All the frame.Iron shot,Fierce and hot,Strike with fearOn the ear;All they slayOn their way.O'er the landPours the band;All take flightAt their sight.

모모Ah, o'er ev'ry plant they rush!Ah, their cruel footsteps crushAll the flowers that fill their path!Who will dare to stem their wrath?

모모Brethren, let us venture all!

모모Virtue in your pure cheek glows.Phoebus will attend our call

모모When he sees our heavy woes;And that we may have arightWeapons suited to the fight,He the mountain shaketh now--From its browRattling downStone on stoneThrough the thicket spread appear.Brethren, seize them! Wherefore fear?Now the villain crew assail,As though with a storm of hail,And expel the strangers wildFrom these regions soft and mildWhere the sun has ever smil'd!

모모What strange wonder do I see?Can it be?All my limbs of power are reft.And all strength my hand has left.Can it he?None are strangers that I see!And our brethren 'tis who goOn before, the way to show!Oh, the reckless impious ones!How they, with their jarring tones,Beat the time, as on they hie!Quick, my brethren!--let us fly!

모모To the rash ones, yet a word!Ay, my voice shall now be heard,As a peal of thunder, strong!

모모Words as poets' arms were made,--

모모When the god will he obey'd,Follow fast his darts ere long.

모모Was it possible that yeThus your godlike dignityShould forget? The Thyrsus rude

모모Must a heavy burden feel

모모To the hand but wont to stealO'er the lyre in gentle mood.From the sparkling waterfalls,From the brook that purling calls,Shall Silenus' loathsome beastBe allow'd at will to feast?Aganippe's * wave he sipsWith profane and spreading lips,--With ungainly feet stamps madly,Till the waters flow on sadly.

모모Fain I'd think myself deluded

모모In the sadd'ning sounds I hear;From the holy glades secluded

모모Hateful tones assail the ear.Laughter wild (exchange how mournful!)

모모Takes the place of love's sweet dream;Women-haters and the scornful

모모In exulting chorus scream.Nightingale and turtle dove

모모Fly their nests so warm and chaste,And, inflamed with sensual love,

모모Holds the Faun the Nymph embrac'd.Here a garment's torn away,

모모Scoffs succeed their sated bliss,While the god, with angry ray,

모모Looks upon each impious kiss.

모모Vapour, smoke, as from a fire,

모모And advancing clouds I view;Chords not only grace the lyre,

모모For the bow its chords bath too.Even the adorer's heart

모모Dreads the wild advancing hand,For the flames that round them dart

모모Show the fierce destroyer's hand.

모모Oh neglect not what I say,

모모For I speak it lovingly!From our boundaries haste away,

모모From the god's dread anger fly!Cleanse once more the holy place,

모모Turn the savage train aside!Earth contains upon its face

모모Many a spot unsanctified;Here we only prize the good.

모모Stars unsullied round us burn.

모모If ye, in repentant mood,

모모From your wanderings would return,--If ye fail to find the bliss

모모That ye found with us of yore,--Or when lawless mirth like this

모모Gives your hearts delight no more,--Then return in pilgrim guise,

모모Gladly up the mountain go,While your strains repentant rise,

모모And our brethren's advent show.

모모Let a new-born wreath entwine

모모Solemnly your temples round;Rapture glows in hearts divine

모모When a long-lost sinner's found.Swifter e'en than Lathe's flood

모모Round Death's silent house can play,Ev'ry error of the good

모모Will love's chalice wash away.All will haste your steps to meet,

모모As ye come in majesty,--Men your blessing will entreat;--

모모Ours ye thus will doubly be!

모모1798.(* Aganippe--A spring in Boeotia, which arose out of MountHelicon, and was sacred to Apollo and the Muses.)-----LILY'S MENAGERIE.

모모[Goethe describes this much-admired Poem, which he wrote inhonour of his love Lily, as being "designed to change hissurrender of her into despair, by drolly-fretful images."]

모모THERE'S no menagerie, I vow,

모모Excels my Lily's at this minute;

모모She keeps the strangest creatures in it,And catches them, she knows not how.

모모Oh, how they hop, and run, and rave,And their clipp'd pinions wildly wave,--Poor princes, who must all endureThe pangs of love that nought can cure.

모모What is the fairy's name?--Is't Lily?--Ask not me!Give thanks to Heaven if she's unknown to thee.

모모Oh what a cackling, what a shrieking,

모모When near the door she takes her stand,

모모With her food-basket in her hand!Oh what a croaking, what a squeaking!Alive all the trees and the bushes appear,While to her feet whole troops draw near;The very fish within, the water clearSplash with impatience and their heads protrude;And then she throws around the foodWith such a look!--the very gods delighting(To say nought of beasts). There begins, then, a biting,A picking, a pecking, a sipping,And each o'er the legs of another is tripping,And pushing, and pressing, and flapping,And chasing, and fuming, and snapping,And all for one small piece of bread,To which, though dry, her fair hands give a taste,As though it in ambrosia had been plac'd.

모모And then her look! the tone

모모With which she calls: Pipi! Pipi!Would draw Jove's eagle from his throne;Yes, Venus' turtle doves, I wean,And the vain peacock e'en,Would come, I swear,Soon as that tone had reach'd them through the air.

모모E'en from a forest dark had she

모모Enticed a bear, unlick'd, ill-bred,

모모And, by her wiles alluring, ledTo join the gentle company,Until as tame as they was he:(Up to a certain point, be't understood!)How fair, and, ah, how goodShe seem'd to be! I would have drain'd my bloodTo water e'en her flow'rets sweet.

모모"Thou sayest: I! Who? How? And where?"--Well, to be plain, good Sirs--I am the bear;

모모In a net-apron, caught, alas!

모모Chain'd by a silk-thread at her feet.

모모But how this wonder came to passI'll tell some day, if ye are curious;Just now, my temper's much too furious.

모모Ah, when I'm in the corner plac'd,

모모And hear afar the creatures snapping,

모모And see the flipping and the flapping,

모모I turn around

모모With growling sound,

모모And backward run a step in haste,

모모And look around

모모With growling sound.

모모Then run again a step in haste,And to my former post go round.

모모But suddenly my anger grows,A mighty spirit fills my nose,My inward feelings all revolt.A creature such as thou! a dolt!Pipi, a squirrel able nuts to crack!I bristle up my shaggy backUnused a slave to be.I'm laughed at by each trim and upstart treeTo scorn. The bowling-green I fly,

모모With neatly-mown and well-kept grass:

모모The box makes faces as I pass,--Into the darkest thicket hasten I,Hoping to 'scape from the ring,Over the palings to spring!Vainly I leap and climb;

모모I feel a leaden spell.

모모That pinions me as well,And when I'm fully wearied out in time,I lay me down beside some mock-cascade,

모모And roll myself half dead, and foam, and cry,

모모And, ah! no Oreads hear my sigh,Excepting those of china made!

모모But, ah, with sudden power

모모In all my members blissful feelings reign!'Tis she who singeth yonder in her bower!

모모I hear that darling, darling voice again.The air is warm, and teems with fragrance clear,Sings she perchance for me alone to hear?

모모I haste, and trample down the shrubs amain;The trees make way, the bushes all retreat,And so--the beast is lying at her feet.

모모She looks at him: "The monster's droll enough!

모모He's, for a bear, too mild,

모모Yet, for a dog, too wild,So shaggy, clumsy, rough!"Upon his back she gently strokes her foot;

모모He thinks himself in Paradise.What feelings through his seven senses shoot!

모모But she looks on with careless eyes.I lick her soles, and kiss her shoes,

모모As gently as a bear well may;Softly I rise, and with a clever ruse

모모Leap on her knee.--On a propitious dayShe suffers it; my ears then tickles she,

모모And hits me a hard blow in wanton play;I growl with new-born ecstasy;Then speaks she in a sweet vain jest, I wot"Allons lout doux! eh! la menotte!Et faites serviteurComme un joli seigneur."Thus she proceeds with sport and glee;

모모Hope fills the oft-deluded beast;Yet if one moment he would lazy be,

모모Her fondness all at once hath ceas'd.

모모She doth a flask of balsam-fire possess,

모모Sweeter than honey bees can make,

모모One drop of which she'll on her finger take,When soften'd by his love and faithfulness,

모모Wherewith her monster's raging thirst to slake;Then leaves me to myself, and flies at last,And I, unbound, yet prison'd fastBy magic, follow in her train,Seek for her, tremble, fly again.The hapless creature thus tormenteth she,

모모Regardless of his pleasure or his woe;Ha! oft half-open'd does she leave the door for me,

모모And sideways looks to learn if I will fly or no.And I--Oh gods! your hands aloneCan end the spell that's o'er me thrown;Free me, and gratitude my heart will fill;

모모And yet from heaven ye send me down no aid--

모모Not quite in vain doth life my limbs pervade:I feel it! Strength is left me still.

모모1775.-----TO CHARLOTTE.

모모'MIDST the noise of merriment and glee,

모모'Midst full many a sorrow, many a care,Charlotte, I remember, we remember thee,

모모How, at evening's hour so fair,Thou a kindly hand didst reach us,

모모When thou, in some happy place

모모Where more fair is Nature s face,

모모Many a lightly-hidden traceOf a spirit loved didst teach us.

모모Well 'tis that thy worth I rightly knew,--

모모That I, in the hour when first we met,

모모While the first impression fill'd me yet,Call'd thee then a girl both good and true.

모모Rear'd in silence, calmly, knowing nought,

모모On the world we suddenly are thrown;Hundred thousand billows round us sport;

모모All things charm us--many please alone,Many grieve us, and as hour on hour is stealing,

모모To and fro our restless natures sway;First we feel, and then we find each feeling

모모By the changeful world-stream borne away.

모모Well I know, we oft within us find

모모Many a hope and many a smart.Charlotte, who can know our mind?

모모Charlotte, who can know our heart?Ah! 'twould fain be understood, 'twould fain o'erflow

모모In some creature's fellow-feelings blest,And, with trust, in twofold measure know

모모All the grief and joy in Nature's breast.

모모Then thine eye is oft around thee cast,

모모But in vain, for all seems closed for ever.Thus the fairest part of life is madly pass'd

모모Free from storm, but resting never:To thy sorrow thou'rt to-day repell'd

모모By what yesterday obey'd thee.Can that world by thee be worthy held

모모Which so oft betray'd thee?

모모Which, 'mid all thy pleasures and thy pains,

모모Lived in selfish, unconcern'd repose?See, the soul its secret cells regains,

모모And the heart--makes haste to close.Thus found I thee, and gladly went to meet thee;

모모"She's worthy of all love!" I cried,And pray'd that Heaven with purest bliss might greet thee,

모모Which in thy friend it richly hath supplied.

모모1776.*-----LOVE'S DISTRESSES.

모모WHO will hear me? Whom shall I lament to?Who would pity me that heard my sorrows?Ah, the lip that erst so many rapturesUsed to taste, and used to give responsive,Now is cloven, and it pains me sorely;And it is not thus severely woundedBy my mistress having caught me fiercely,And then gently bitten me, intendingTo secure her friend more firmly to her:No, my tender lip is crack'd thus, onlyBy the winds, o'er rime and frost proceeding,Pointed, sharp, unloving, having met me.Now the noble grape's bright juice commingledWith the bee's sweet juice, upon the fireOf my hearth, shall ease me of my torment.Ah, what use will all this be, if with itLove adds not a drop of his own balsam?

모모1789.*-----THE MUSAGETES.

모모IN the deepest nights of WinterTo the Muses kind oft cried I:"Not a ray of morn is gleaming,Not a sign of daylight breaking;Bring, then, at the fitting moment,Bring the lamp's soft glimm'ring lustre,'Stead of Phoebus and Aurora,To enliven my still labours!"Yet they left me in my slumbers,Dull and unrefreshing, lying,And to each late-waken'd morningFollow'd days devoid of profit.

모모When at length return'd the spring-time,To the nightingales thus spake I:"Darling nightingales, oh, beat yeEarly, early at my window,--Wake me from the heavy slumberThat chains down the youth so strongly!"Yet the love-o'erflowing songstersTheir sweet melodies protractedThrough the night before my window,Kept awake my loving spirit,Rousing new and tender yearningsIn my newly-waken'd bosom.And the night thus fleeted o'er me,And Aurora found me sleeping,--Ay, the sun could scarce arouse me.

모모Now at length is come the Summer,And the early fly so busyDraws me from my pleasing slumbersAt the first-born morning-glimmer.Mercilessly then returns she,Though the half-aroused one oftenScares her from him with impatience,And she lures her shameless sisters,So that from my weary eyelidsKindly sleep ere long is driven.From my couch then boldly spring I,And I seek the darling Muses,in the beechen-grove I find them,Full of pieasure to receive me;And to the tormenting insectsOwe I many a golden hour.Thus be ye, unwelcome beings,Highly valued by the poet,As the flies my numbers tell of.

모모1798.-----MORNING LAMENT.

모모OH thou cruel deadly-lovely maiden,Tell me what great sin have I committed,That thou keep'st me to the rack thus fasten'd,That thou hast thy solemn promise broken?

모모'Twas but yestere'en that thou with fondnessPress'd my hand, and these sweet accents murmured:"Yes, I'll come, I'll come when morn approacheth,Come, my friend, full surely to thy chamber."

모모On the latch I left my doors, unfasten'd,Having first with care tried all the hinges,And rejoic'd right well to find they creak'd not.

모모What a night of expectation pass'd I!For I watch'd, and ev'ry chime I number'd;If perchance I slept a few short moments,Still my heart remain'd awake forever,And awoke me from my gentle slumbers.

모모Yes, then bless'd I night's o'erhanging darkness,That so calmly cover'd all things round me;I enjoy'd the universal silence,While I listen'd ever in the silence,If perchance the slightest sounds were stirring.

모모"Had she only thoughts, my thoughts resembling,Had she only feelings, like my feelings,She would not await the dawn of morning.But, ere this, would surely have been with me."

모모Skipp'd a kitten on the floor above me,Scratch'd a mouse a panel in the corner,Was there in the house the slightest motion,Ever hoped I that I heard thy footstep,Ever thought I that I heard thee coming.And so lay I long, and ever longer,And already was the daylight dawning,And both here and there were signs of movement.

모모"Is it yon door? Were it my door only!"In my bed I lean'd upon my elbow,Looking tow'rd the door, now half-apparent,If perchance it might not be in motion.Both the wings upon the latch continued,On the quiet hinges calmly hanging.

모모And the day grew bright and brighter ever;And I heard my neighbour's door unbolted,As he went to earn his daily wages,And ere long I heard the waggons rumbling,And the city gates were also open'd,While the market-place, in ev'ry corner,Teem'd with life and bustle and confusion.

모모In the house was going now and comingUp and down the stairs, and doors were creakingBackwards now, now forwards,--footsteps clatter'dYet, as though it were a thing all-living,From my cherish'd hope I could not tear me.

모모When at length the sun, in hated splendour.Fell upon my walls, upon my windows,Up I sprang, and hasten'd to the garden,There to blend my breath, so hot and yearning,With the cool refreshing morning breezes,And, it might be, even there to meet thee:But I cannot find thee in the arbour,Or the avenue of lofty lindens.

모모1789.*-----THE VISIT.

모모FAIN had I to-day surprised my mistress,But soon found I that her door was fasten'd.Yet I had the key safe in my pocket,And the darling door I open'd softly!In the parlour found I not the maiden,Found the maiden not within her closet,Then her chamber-door I gently open'd,When I found her wrapp'd in pleasing slumbers,Fully dress'd, and lying on the sofa.

모모While at work had slumber stolen o'er her;For her knitting and her needle found IResting in her folded bands so tender;And I placed myself beside her softly,And held counsel, whether I should wake her.

모모Then I looked upon the beauteous quietThat on her sweet eyelids was reposingOn her lips was silent truth depicted,On her cheeks had loveliness its dwelling,And the pureness of a heart unsulliedIn her bosom evermore was heaving.All her limbs were gracefully reclining,Set at rest by sweet and godlike balsam.Gladly sat I, and the contemplationHeld the strong desire I felt to wake herFirmer and firmer down, with mystic fetters.

모모"Oh, thou love," methought, "I see that slumber,Slumber that betrayeth each false feature,Cannot injure thee, can nought discoverThat could serve to harm thy friend's soft feelings.

모모"Now thy beauteous eyes are firmly closed,That, when open, form mine only rapture.And thy sweet lips are devoid of motion,Motionless for speaking or for kissing;Loosen'd are the soft and magic fettersOf thine arms, so wont to twine around me,And the hand, the ravishing companionOf thy sweet caresses, lies unmoving.Were my thoughts of thee but based on error,Were the love I bear thee self-deception,I must now have found it out, since AmorIs, without his bandage, placed beside me."

모모Long I sat thus, full of heartfelt pleasureAt my love, and at her matchless merit;She had so delighted me while slumbering,That I could not venture to awake her.

모모Then I on the little table near herSoftly placed two oranges, two roses;Gently, gently stole I from her chamber.When her eyes the darling one shall open,She will straightway spy these colourd presents,And the friendly gift will view with wonder,For the door will still remain unopen'd.

모모If perchance I see to-night the angel,How will she rejoice,--reward me doublyFor this sacrifice of fond affection!

모모1765.-----THE MAGIC NET.

모모Do I see a contest yonder?See I miracles or pastimes?Beauteous urchins, five in number,'Gainst five sisters fair contending,--Measured is the time they're beating--At a bright enchantress' bidding.Glitt'ring spears by some are wielded,Threads are others nimbly twining,

모모So that in their snares, the weaponsOne would think, must needs be captured,Soon, in truth, the spears are prison'd;Yet they, in the gentle war-dance,One by one escape their fettersIn the row of loops so tender,That make haste to seize a free oneSoon as they release a captive.

모모So with contests, strivings, triumphs,Flying now, and now returning,Is an artful net soon woven,In its whiteness like the snow-flakes,That, from light amid the darkness,Draw their streaky lines so varied,As e'en colours scarce can draw them.

모모Who shall now receive that garmentFar beyond all others wish'd-for?Whom our much-loved mistress favourAs her own acknowledged servant?I am blest by kindly Fortune'sTokens true, in silence pray'd for!And I feel myself held captive,To her service now devoted.

모모Yet, e'en while I, thus enraptured,Thus adorn'd, am proudly wand'ring,See! yon wantons are entwining,Void of strife, with secret ardour,Other nets, each fine and finer,Threads of twilight interweaving,Moonbeams sweet, night-violets' balsam.

모모Ere the net is noticed by us,Is a happier one imprison'd,Whom we, one and all, togetherGreet with envy and with blessings.

모모1803.-----THE GOBLET.

모모ONCE I held a well-carved brimming goblet,--In my two hands tightly clasp'd I held it,Eagerly the sweet wine sipp'd I from it,Seeking there to drown all care and sorrow.

모모Amor enter'd in, and found me sitting,And he gently smiled in modest fashion,Smiled as though the foolish one he pitied.

모모"Friend, I know a far more beauteous vessel,One wherein to sink thy spirit wholly;Say, what wilt thou give me, if I grant it,And with other nectar fill it for thee?"

모모Oh, how kindly hath he kept his promise!For to me, who long had yearn'd, he grantedThee, my Lida, fill'd with soft affection.

모모When I clasp mine arms around thee fondly,When I drink in love's long-hoarded balsamFrom thy darling lips so true, so faithful,Fill'd with bliss thus speak I to my spirit"No! a vessel such as this, save AmorNever god hath fashion'd or been lord of!Such a form was ne'er produced by VulcanWith his cunning, reason-gifted hammers!On the leaf-crown'd mountains may LyaeusBid his Fauns, the oldest and the wisest,Pass the choicest clusters through the winepress,And himself watch o'er the fermentation:Such a draught no toil can e'er procure him!"

모모1781.-----TO THE GRASSHOPPER.

모모AFTER ANACREON.

모모[The strong resemblance of this fine poem to Cowley's Ode bearingthe same name, and beginning "Happy insect! what can be," will beat once seen.]

모모HAPPY art thou, darling insect,Who, upon the trees' tall branches,By a modest draught inspired,Singing, like a monarch livest!Thou possessest as thy portionAll that on the plains thou seest,All that by the hours is brought thee'Mongst the husbandmen thou livest,As a friend, uninjured by them,Thou whom mortals love to honour,Herald sweet of sweet Spring's advent!Yes, thou'rt loved by all the Muses,

모모Phoebus' self, too, needs must love thee;They their silver voices gave thee,Age can never steal upon thee.Wise and gentle friend of poets,Born a creature fleshless, bloodless,Though Earth's daughter, free from suff'ring,To the gods e'en almost equal.

모모1781.-----FROM 'THE SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER.'

모모[Prefixed to the second edition.]

모모EV'RY youth for love's sweet portion sighs,

모모Ev'ry maiden sighs to win man's love;Why, alas! should bitter pain arise

모모From the noblest passion that we prove?

모모Thou, kind soul, bewailest, lov'st him well,

모모From disgrace his memory's saved by thee;Lo, his spirit signs from out its cell:

모모BE A MAN, NOR SEEK TO FOLLOW ME.

모모1775.-----TRILOGY OF PASSION.

모모I. TO WERTHER.

모모[This poem, written at the age of seventy-five, was appended toan edition of 'Werther,' published at that time.]

모모ONCE more, then, much-wept shadow, thou dost dare

모모Boldly to face the day's clear light,To meet me on fresh blooming meadows fair,

모모And dost not tremble at my sight.Those happy times appear return'd once more.

모모When on one field we quaff'd refreshing dew,And, when the day's unwelcome toils were o'er,

모모The farewell sunbeams bless'd our ravish'd view;Fate bade thee go,--to linger here was mine,--Going the first, the smaller loss was thine.

모모The life of man appears a glorious fate:The day how lovely, and the night how great!And we 'mid Paradise-like raptures plac'd,The sun's bright glory scarce have learn'd to taste.

모모When strange contending feelings dimly cover,Now us, and now the forms that round us hover;One's feelings by no other are supplied,'Tis dark without, if all is bright inside;An outward brightness veils my sadden'd mood,When Fortune smiles,--how seldom understood!Now think we that we know her, and with mightA woman's beauteous form instils delight;The youth, as glad as in his infancy,The spring-time treads, as though the spring were heRavish'd, amazed, he asks, how this is done?He looks around, the world appears his own.With careless speed he wanders on through space,Nor walls, nor palaces can check his race;As some gay flight of birds round tree-tops plays,So 'tis with him who round his mistress strays;He seeks from AEther, which he'd leave behind him,The faithful look that fondly serves to bind him.

모모Yet first too early warn'd, and then too late,He feels his flight restrain'd, is captur'd straightTo meet again is sweet, to part is sad,Again to meet again is still more glad,And years in one short moment are enshrin'd;But, oh, the harsh farewell is hid behind!

모모Thou smilest, friend, with fitting thoughts inspired;By a dread parting was thy fame acquired,Thy mournful destiny we sorrow'd o'er,For weal and woe thou left'st us evermore,And then again the passions' wavering forceDrew us along in labyrinthine course;And we, consumed by constant misery,At length must part--and parting is to die!How moving is it, when the minstrel sings,To 'scape the death that separation brings!Oh grant, some god, to one who suffers so,To tell, half-guilty, his sad tale of woe

모모1824

모모II. ELEGY.

모모When man had ceased to utter his lament,

모모A god then let me tell my tale of sorrow.

모모WHAT hope of once more meeting is there nowIn the still-closed blossoms of this day?Both heaven and hell thrown open seest thou;What wav'ring thoughts within the bosom playNo longer doubt! Descending from the sky,She lifts thee in her arms to realms on high.

모모And thus thou into Paradise wert brought,

모모As worthy of a pure and endless life;Nothing was left, no wish, no hope, no thought,

모모Here was the boundary of thine inmost strife:And seeing one so fair, so glorified,The fount of yearning tears was straightway dried.

모모No motion stirr'd the day's revolving wheel,

모모In their own front the minutes seem'd to go;The evening kiss, a true and binding seal,

모모Ne'er changing till the morrow's sunlight glow.The hours resembled sisters as they went.Yet each one from another different.

모모The last hour's kiss, so sadly sweet, effac'd

모모A beauteous network of entwining love.Now on the threshold pause the feet, now haste.

모모As though a flaming cherub bade them move;The unwilling eye the dark road wanders o'er,Backward it looks, but closed it sees the door.

모모And now within itself is closed this breast,

모모As though it ne'er were open, and as though,Vying with ev'ry star, no moments blest

모모Had, in its presence, felt a kindling glow;Sadness, reproach, repentance, weight of care,Hang heavy on it in the sultry air.

모모Is not the world still left? The rocky steeps,

모모Are they with holy shades no longer crown'd?Grows not the harvest ripe? No longer creeps

모모The espalier by the stream,--the copse around?Doth not the wondrous arch of heaven still rise,Now rich in shape, now shapeless to the eyes?

모모As, seraph-like, from out the dark clouds' chorus,

모모With softness woven, graceful, light, and fair,Resembling Her, in the blue aether o'er us,

모모A slender figure hovers in the air,--Thus didst thou see her joyously advance,The fairest of the fairest in the dance.

모모Yet but a moment dost thou boldly dare

모모To clasp an airy form instead of hers;Back to thine heart! thou'lt find it better there,

모모For there in changeful guise her image stirsWhat erst was one, to many turneth fast,In thousand forms, each dearer than the last.

모모As at the door, on meeting lingerd she,

모모And step by step my faithful ardour bless'd,For the last kiss herself entreated me,

모모And on my lips the last last kiss impress'd,--Thus clearly traced, the lov'd one's form we view,With flames engraven on a heart so true,--

모모A heart that, firm as some embattled tower,

모모Itself for her, her in itself reveres,For her rejoices in its lasting power,

모모Conscious alone, when she herself appears;Feels itself freer in so sweet a thrall,And only beats to give her thanks in all.

모모The power of loving, and all yearning sighs

모모For love responsive were effaced and drown'd;While longing hope for joyous enterprise

모모Was form'd, and rapid action straightway found;If love can e'er a loving one inspire,Most lovingly it gave me now its fire;

모모And 'twas through her!--an inward sorrow lay

모모On soul and body, heavily oppress'd;To mournful phantoms was my sight a prey,

모모In the drear void of a sad tortured breast;Now on the well-known threshold Hope hath smil'd,Herself appeareth in the sunlight mild.

모모Unto the peace of God, which, as we read,

모모Blesseth us more than reason e'er bath done,Love's happy peace would I compare indeed,

모모When in the presence of the dearest one.There rests the heart, and there that sweetest thought,The thought of being hers, is check'd by nought.

모모In the pure bosom doth a yearning float,

모모Unto a holier, purer, unknown BeingIts grateful aspiration to devote,

모모The Ever-Nameless then unriddled seeing;We call it: piety!--such blest delightI feel a share in, when before her sight.

모모Before her sight, as 'neath the sun's hot ray,

모모Before her breath, as 'neath the spring's soft wind,In its deep wintry cavern melts away

모모Self-love, so long in icy chains confin'd;No selfishness and no self-will are nigh,For at her advent they were forced to fly.

모모It seems as though she said: "As hours pass by

모모They spread before us life with kindly plan;Small knowledge did the yesterday supply,

모모To know the morrow is conceal'd from man;And if the thought of evening made me start,The sun at setting gladden'd straight my heart.

모모"Act, then, as I, and look, with joyous mind,

모모The moment in the face; nor linger thou!Meet it with speed, so fraught with life, so kind

모모In action, and in love so radiant now;Let all things be where thou art, childlike ever,Thus thoult be all, thus, thou'lt be vanquish'd never."

모모Thou speakest well, methought, for as thy guide

모모The moment's favour did a god assign,And each one feels himself when by thy side,

모모Fate's fav'rite in a moment so divine;I tremble at thy look that bids me go,Why should I care such wisdom vast to know?

모모Now am I far! And what would best befit

모모The present minute? I could scarcely tell;Full many a rich possession offers it,

모모These but offend, and I would fain repel.Yearnings unquenchable still drive me on,All counsel, save unbounded tears, is gone.

모모Flow on, flow on in never-ceasing course,

모모Yet may ye never quench my inward fire!Within my bosom heaves a mighty force,

모모Where death and life contend in combat dire.Medicines may serve the body's pangs to still;Nought but the spirit fails in strength of will,--

모모Fails in conception; wherefore fails it so?

모모A thousand times her image it portrays;Enchanting now, and now compell'd to go,

모모Now indistinct, now clothed in purest rays!How could the smallest comfort here be flowing?The ebb and flood, the coming and the going!

모모*      *      *      *      *      *

모모Leave me here now, my life's companions true!

모모Leave me alone on rock, in moor and heath;But courage! open lies the world to you,

모모The glorious heavens above, the earth beneath;Observe, investigate, with searching eyes,And nature will disclose her mysteries.

모모To me is all, I to myself am lost,

모모Who the immortals' fav'rite erst was thought;They, tempting, sent Pandoras to my cost,

모모So rich in wealth, with danger far more fraught;They urged me to those lips, with rapture crown'd,Deserted me, and hurl'd me to the ground.

모모1823.

모모III.  ATONEMENT.

모모[Composed, when 74 years old, for a Polish lady, who excelled inplaying on the pianoforte.]

모모PASSION brings reason--who can pacify

모모An anguish'd heart whose loss hath been so great?Where are the hours that fled so swiftly by?

모모In vain the fairest thou didst gain from fate;Sad is the soul, confused the enterprise;

모모The glorious world, how on the sense it dies!

모모In million tones entwined for evermore,

모모Music with angel-pinions hovers there,To pierce man's being to its inmost core,

모모Eternal beauty has its fruit to bear;The eye grows moist, in yearnings blest reveresThe godlike worth of music as of tears.

모모And so the lighten'd heart soon learns to see

모모That it still lives, and beats, and ought to beat,Off'ring itself with joy and willingly,

모모In grateful payment for a gift so sweet.And then was felt,--oh may it constant prove!--The twofold bliss of music and of love.

모모1823.-----

모모THE remembrance of the GoodKeep us ever glad in mood.

모모The remembrance of the FairMakes a mortal rapture share.

모모The remembrance of one's LoveBlest Is, if it constant prove.

모모The remembrance of the OneIs the greatest joy that's known.

모모1828.-----[Written at the age of 77.]

모모WHEN I was still a youthful wight,

모모So full of enjoyment and merry,The painters used to assert, in spite,

모모That my features were small--yes, very;Yet then full many a beauteous childWith true affection upon me smil'd.

모모Now as a greybeard I sit here in state,

모모By street and by lane held in awe, sirs;And may be seen, like old Frederick the Great,

모모On pipebowls, on cups, and on saucers.Yet the beauteous maidens, they keep afar;Oh vision of youth! Oh golden star!

모모1826.-----FOR EVER.

모모THE happiness that man, whilst prison'd here,

모모Is wont with heavenly rapture to compare,--The harmony of Truth, from wavering clear,--

모모Of Friendship that is free from doubting care,--The light which in stray thoughts alone can cheer

모모The wise,--the bard alone in visions fair,--In my best hours I found in her all this,And made mine own, to mine exceeding bliss.

모모1820.*-----FROM AN ALBUM OF 1604.

모모HOPE provides wings to thought, and love to hope.Rise up to Cynthia, love, when night is clearest,And say, that as on high her figure changeth,So, upon earth, my joy decays and grows.And whisper in her ear with modest softness,How doubt oft hung its head, and truth oft wept.And oh ye thoughts, distrustfully inclined,If ye are therefore by the loved one chided,Answer: 'tis true ye change, but alter not,As she remains the same, yet changeth ever.Doubt may invade the heart, but poisons not,For love is sweeter, by suspicion flavour'd.If it with anger overcasts the eye,And heaven's bright purity perversely blackens,Then zephyr-sighs straight scare the clouds away,And, changed to tears, dissolve them into rain.Thought, hope, and love remain there as before,Till Cynthia gleams upon me as of old.

모모1820.*-----LINES ON SEEING SCHILLER'S SKULL.

모모[This curious imitation of the ternary metre of Dante was writtenat the age of 77.]

모모WITHIN a gloomy charnel-house one day

모모I view'd the countless skulls, so strangely mated,And of old times I thought, that now were grey.

모모Close pack'd they stand, that once so fiercely hated,And hardy bones, that to the death contended,

모모Are lying cross'd,--to lie for ever, fated.What held those crooked shoulder-blades suspended?

모모No one now asks; and limbs with vigour fired,The hand, the foot--their use in life is ended.

모모Vainly ye sought the tomb for rest when tired;Peace in the grave may not be yours; ye're driven

모모Back into daylight by a force inspired;But none can love the wither'd husk, though even

모모A glorious noble kernel it contained.To me, an adept, was the writing given

모모Which not to all its holy sense explained,When 'mid the crowd, their icy shadows flinging,

모모I saw a form, that glorious still remained.And even there, where mould and damp were clinging,

모모Gave me a blest, a rapture-fraught emotion,As though from death a living fount were springing.

모모What mystic joy I felt! What rapt devotion!That form, how pregnant with a godlike trace!

모모A look, how did it whirl me tow'rd that oceanWhose rolling billows mightier shapes embrace!

모모Mysterious vessel! Oracle how dear!Even to grasp thee is my hand too base,

모모Except to steal thee from thy prison hereWith pious purpose, and devoutly go

모모Back to the air, free thoughts, and sunlight clear.What greater gain in life can man e'er know

모모Than when God-Nature will to him explainHow into Spirit steadfastness may flow,

모모How steadfast, too, the Spirit-Born remain.

모모1826.-----ROYAL PRAYER.

모모HA, I am the lord of earth! The noble,

모모Who're in my service, love me.Ha, I am the lord of earth! The noble,

모모O'er whom my sway extendeth, love I.Oh, grant me, God in Heaven, that I may ne'er

모모Dispense with loftiness and love!

모모1833.*-----EXPLANATION  OF AN ANCIENT WOODCUT, REPRESENTINGHANS SACHS' POETICAL MISSION.

모모[I feel considerable hesitation in venturing to offer thisversion of a poem which Carlyle describes to be 'a beautifulpiece (a very Hans Sacks beatified, both in character and style),which we wish there was any possibility of translating.' Thereader will be aware that Hans Sachs was the celebrated Minstrel-Cobbler of Nuremberg, who Wrote 208 plays, 1700 comic tales, andbetween 4000 and 5000 lyric poems. He flourished throughoutalmost the whole of the 16th century.]

모모EARLY within his workshop here,On Sundays stands our master dear;His dirty apron he puts away,And wears a cleanly doublet to-day;Lets wax'd thread, hammer, and pincers rest,And lays his awl within his chest;The seventh day he takes reposeFrom many pulls and many blows.

모모Soon as the spring-sun meets his view,Repose begets him labour anew;He feels that he holds within his brainA little world, that broods there amain,And that begins to act and to live,Which he to others would gladly give.

모모He had a skilful eye and true,And was full kind and loving too.For contemplation, clear and pure,--For making all his own again, sure;He had a tongue that charm'd when 'twas heard,And graceful and light flow'd ev'ry word;Which made the Muses in him rejoice,The Master-singer of their choice.

모모And now a maiden enter'd there,With swelling breast, and body fair;With footing firm she took her place,And moved with stately, noble grace;She did not walk in wanton mood,Nor look around with glances lewd.

모모She held a measure in her hand,Her girdle was a golden band,A wreath of corn was on her head,Her eye the day's bright lustre shed;Her name is honest Industry,Else, Justice, Magnanimity.

모모She enter'd with a kindly greeting;He felt no wonder at the meeting,For, kind and fair as she might be,He long had known her, fancied he.

모모"I have selected thee," she said,"From all who earth's wild mazes tread,That thou shouldst have clear-sighted sense,And nought that's wrong shouldst e'er commence.When others run in strange confusion,Thy gaze shall see through each illusionWhen others dolefully complain,Thy cause with jesting thou shalt gain,Honour and right shalt value duly,In everything act simply, truly,--Virtue and godliness proclaim,And call all evil by its name,Nought soften down, attempt no quibble,Nought polish up, nought vainly scribble.The world shall stand before thee, then,As seen by Albert Durer's ken,In manliness and changeless life,In inward strength, with firmness rife.Fair Nature's Genius by the handShall lead thee on through every land,Teach thee each different life to scan,Show thee the wondrous ways of man,His shifts, confusions, thrustings, and drubbings,Pushings, tearings, pressings, and rubbings;The varying madness of the crew,The anthill's ravings bring to view;But thou shalt see all this express'd,As though 'twere in a magic chest.Write these things down for folks on earth,In hopes they may to wit give birth."--Then she a window open'd wide,And show'd a motley crowd outside,All kinds of beings 'neath the sky,As in his writings one may spy.

모모Our master dear was, after this,On Nature thinking, full of bliss,When tow'rd him, from the other sideHe saw an aged woman glide;The name she bears, Historia,Mythologia, Fabula;With footstep tottering and unstableShe dragg'd a large and wooden carved-table,Where, with wide sleeves and human mien,The Lord was catechizing seen;Adam, Eve, Eden, the Serpent's seduction,Gomorrah and Sodom's awful destruction,The twelve illustrious women, too,That mirror of honour brought to view;All kinds of bloodthirstiness, murder, and sin,The twelve wicked tyrants also were in,And all kinds of goodly doctrine and law;Saint Peter with his scourge you saw,With the world's ways dissatisfied,And by our Lord with power supplied.Her train and dress, behind and before,And e'en the seams, were painted o'erWith tales of worldly virtue and crime.--Our master view'd all this for a time;The sight right gladly he survey'd,So useful for him in his trade,Whence he was able to procureExample good and precept sure,Recounting all with truthful care,As though he had been present there.His spirit seem'd from earth to fly,He ne'er had turned away his eye,Did he not just behind him hearA rattle of bells approaching near.And now a fool doth catch his eye,With goat and ape's leap drawing nighA merry interlude preparingWith fooleries and jests unsparing.Behind him, in a line drawn out,He dragg'd all fools, the lean and stout,The great and little, the empty and full,All too witty, and all too dull,A lash he flourish'd overhead,As though a dance of apes he led,Abusing them with bitterness,As though his wrath would ne'er grow less.

모모While on this sight our master gazed,His head was growing well-nigh crazed:What words for all could he e'er find,Could such a medley be combined?Could he continue with delightFor evermore to sing and write?When lo, from out a cloud's dark bedIn at the upper window spedThe Muse, in all her majesty,As fair as our loved maids we see.With clearness she around him threwHer truth, that ever stronger grew.

모모"I, to ordain thee come," she spake:"So prosper, and my blessing take!The holy fire that slumb'ring liesWithin thee, in bright flames shall rise;Yet that thine ever-restless lifeMay still with kindly strength be rife,I, for thine inward spirit's calm.Have granted nourishment and balm,That rapture may thy soul imbue,Like some fair blossom bathed in dew."--Behind his house then secretlyOutside the doorway pointed she,Where, in a shady garden-nook,A beauteous maid with downcast lookWas sitting where a stream was flowing,With elder bushes near it growing,She sat beneath an apple tree,And nought around her seem'd to see.Her lap was full of roses fair,Which in a wreath she twined with care.And, with them, leaves and blossoms blended:For whom was that sweet wreath intended?Thus sat she, modest and retired,Her bosom throbb'd, with hope inspired;Such deep forebodings fill'd her mind,No room for wishing could she find,And with the thoughts that o'er it flew,Perchance a sigh was mingled too.

모모"But why should sorrow cloud thy brow?That, dearest love, which fills thee nowIs fraught with joy and ecstasy.Prepared in one alone for thee,That he within thine eye may findSolace when fortune proves unkind,And be newborn through many a kiss,That he receives with inward bliss;When'er he clasps thee to his breast.May he from all his toils find restWhen he in thy dear arms shall sink,May he new life and vigour drink:Fresh joys of youth shalt thou obtain,In merry jest rejoice again.With raillery and roguish spite,Thou now shalt tease him, now delight.Thus Love will nevermore grow old,Thus will the minstrel ne'er be cold!"

모모While he thus lives, in secret bless'd,Above him in the clouds doth restAn oak-wreath, verdant and sublime,Placed on his brow in after-time;While they are banish'd to the slough,Who their great master disavow.

모모IN spreading mantle to my chin conceald,

모모I trod the rocky path, so steep and grey,

모모Then to the wintry plain I bent my wayUneasily, to flight my bosom steel'd.

모모But sudden was the newborn day reveal'd:

모모A maiden came, in heavenly bright array,

모모Like the fair creatures of the poet's layIn realms of song. My yearning heart was heal'd.

모모Yet turn'd I thence, till she had onward pass'd,

모모While closer still the folds to draw I tried,

모모As though with heat self-kindled to grow warm;

모모But follow'd her. She stood. The die was cast!

모모No more within my mantle could I hide;

모모Thou sprang'st with me, on many a spring-morn fair.

모모"For such a daughter, with what pleasing care,Would I, as father, happy dwellings raise!"

모모And when thou on the world didst cast thy gaze,

모모Thy joy was then in household toils to share.

모모"Why did I trust her, why she trust me e'er?For such a sister, how I Heaven should praise!"

모모Nothing can now the beauteous growth retard;

모모Love's glowing flame within my breast is fann'd.

모모Shall I embrace her form, my grief to end?

모모Thee as a queen must I, alas, regard:

모모So high above me placed thou seem'st to stand;

모모Before a passing look I meekly bend.

모모1807?.-----FOOD IN TRAVEL.

모모IF to her eyes' bright lustre I were blind,

모모No longer would they serve my life to gild.

모모The will of destiny must be fulfilid,--This knowing, I withdrew with sadden'd mind.

모모No further happiness I now could find:

모모The former longings of my heart were still'd;

모모I sought her looks alone, whereon to buildMy joy in life,--all else was left behind.

모모Wine's genial glow, the festal banquet gay,

모모Ease, sleep, and friends, all wonted pleasures glad

모모I spurn'd, till little there remain'd to prove.

모모Now calmly through the world I wend my way:

모모That which I crave may everywhere be had,

모모With me I bring the one thing needful--love.

모모1807?.-----DEPARTURE.

모모WITH many a thousand kiss not yet content,

모모At length with One kiss I was forced to go;

모모After that bitter parting's depth of woe,I deem'd the shore from which my steps I bent,

모모Its hills, streams, dwellings, mountains, as I went,

모모A pledge of joy, till daylight ceased to glow;

모모Then on my sight did blissful visions growIn the dim-lighted, distant firmament,

모모And when at length the sea confined my gaze,

모모My ardent longing fill'd my heart once more;

모모What I had lost, unwillingly I sought.

모모Then Heaven appear'd to shed its kindly rays:

모모Methought that all I had possess'd of yore

모모Remain'd still mine--that I was reft of nought.

모모1807?.-----THE LOVING ONE WRITES.

모모THE look that thy sweet eyes on mine impress

모모The pledge thy lips to mine convey,--the kiss,--

모모He who, like me, hath knowledge sure of this,Can he in aught beside find happiness?

모모Removed from thee, friend-sever'd, in distress,

모모These thoughts I vainly struggle to dismiss:

모모They still return to that one hour of bliss,The only one; then tears my grief confess.

모모But unawares the tear makes haste to dry:

모모He loves, methinks, e'en to these glades so still,--

모모And shalt not thou to distant lands extend?

모모Receive the murmurs of his loving sigh;

모모My only joy on earth is in thy will,

모모Thy kindly will tow'rd me; a token send!

모모1807?.-----THE LOVING ONE ONCE MORE.

모모WHY do I o'er my paper once more bend?

모모Ask not too closely, dearest one, I pray

모모For, to speak truth, I've nothing now to say;Yet to thy hands at length 'twill come, dear friend.

모모Since I can come not with it, what I send

모모My undivided heart shall now convey,

모모With all its joys, hopes, pleasures, pains, to-day:All this hath no beginning, hath no end.

모모Henceforward I may ne'er to thee confide

모모How, far as thought, wish, fancy, will, can reach,

모모My faithful heart with thine is surely blended.

모모Thus stood I once enraptured by thy side,

모모Gazed on thee, and said nought. What need of speech?

모모My very being in itself was ended.

모모1807?.-----SHE CANNOT END.

모모WHEN unto thee I sent the page all white,

모모Instead of first thereon inscribing aught,

모모The space thou doubtless filledst up in sport.And sent it me, to make my joy grow bright.

모모As soon as the blue cover met my sight,

모모As well becomes a woman, quick as thought

모모I tore it open, leaving hidden nought,And read the well-known words of pure delight:

모모MY ONLY BEING! DEAREST HEART! SWEET CHILD!

모모How kindly thou my yearning then didst still

모모With gentle words, enthralling me to thee.

모모In truth methought I read thy whispers mild

모모Wherewith thou lovingly my soul didst fill,

모모E'en to myself for aye ennobling me.

모모1807?.-----NEMESIS.

모모WHEN through the nations stalks contagion wild,

모모We from them cautiously should steal away.

모모E'en I have oft with ling'ring and delayShunn'd many an influence, not to be defil'd.

모모And e'en though Amor oft my hours beguil'd,

모모At length with him preferr'd I not to play,

모모And so, too, with the wretched sons of clay,When four and three-lined verses they compil'd.

모모But punishment pursues the scoffer straight,

모모As if by serpent-torch of furies led

모모From bill to vale, from land to sea to fly.

모모I hear the genie's laughter at my fate;

모모Yet do I find all power of thinking fled

모모In sonnet-rage and love's fierce ecstasy.

모모1807-8.-----THE CHRISTMAS-BOX.

모모THIS box, mine own sweet darling, thou wilt find

모모With many a varied sweetmeat's form supplied;

모모The fruits are they of holy Christmas tide,But baked indeed, for children's use design'd.

모모I'd fain, in speeches sweet with skill combin'd,

모모Poetic sweetmeats for the feast provide;

모모But why in such frivolities confide?Perish the thought, with flattery to blind!

모모One sweet thing there is still, that from within,

모모Within us speaks,--that may be felt afar;

모모This may be wafted o'er to thee alone.

모모If thou a recollection fond canst win,

모모As if with pleasure gleam'd each well-known star,

모모The smallest gift thou never wilt disown.

모모1807.-----THE WARNING.

모모WHEN sounds the trumpet at the Judgment Day,

모모And when forever all things earthly die,

모모We must a full and true account supplyOf ev'ry useless word we dropp'd in play.

모모But what effect will all the words convey

모모Wherein with eager zeal and lovingly,

모모That I might win thy favour, labour'd I,If on thine ear alone they die away?

모모Therefore, sweet love, thy conscience bear in mind,

모모Remember well how long thou hast delay'd,

모모So that the world such sufferings may not know.

모모If I must reckon, and excuses find

모모For all things useless I to thee have said,

모모To a full year the Judgment Day will grow

모모1807?.-----THE EPOCHS.

모모ON Petrarch's heart, all other days before,

모모In flaming letters written, was impress d

모모GOOD FRIDAY. And on mine, be it confess'd,Is this year's ADVENT, as it passeth o'er.

모모I do not now begin,--I still adore

모모Her whom I early cherish'd in my breast;,

모모Then once again with prudence dispossess'd,And to whose heart I'm driven back once more.

모모The love of Petrarch, that all-glorious love,

모모Was unrequited, and, alas, full sad;

모모One long Good Friday 'twas, one heartache drear

모모But may my mistress' Advent ever prove,

모모With its palm-jubilee, so sweet and glad,

모모One endless Mayday, through the livelong year!

모모1807.-----THE DOUBTERS AND THE LOVERS.

모모THE DOUBTERS.

모모YE love, and sonnets write! Fate's strange behest!

모모The heart, its hidden meaning to declare,

모모Must seek for rhymes, uniting pair with pair:Learn, children, that the will is weak, at best.

모모Scarcely with freedom the o'erflowing breast

모모As yet can speak, and well may it beware;

모모Tempestuous passions sweep each chord that's there,Then once more sink to night and gentle rest.

모모Why vex yourselves and us, the heavy stone

모모Up the steep path but step by step to roll?

모모It falls again, and ye ne'er cease to strive.

모모THE LOVERS.

모모But we are on the proper road alone!

모모If gladly is to thaw the frozen soul,

모모The fire of love must aye be kept alive.

모모1807?.-----CHARADE.

모모Two words there 'are, both short, of beauty rare,

모모Whose sounds our lips so often love to frame,

모모But which with clearness never can proclaimThe things whose own peculiar stamp they bear.

모모'Tis well in days of age and youth so fair,

모모One on the other boldly to inflame;

모모And if those words together link'd we name,A blissful rapture we discover there.

모모But now to give them pleasure do I seek,

모모And in myself my happiness would find;

모모I hope in silence, but I hope for this:

모모Gently, as loved one's names, those words to speak

모모To see them both within one image shrin'd,

모모Both in one being to embrace with bliss.

모모1807.-----

모모EPIGRAMS.

모모-----In these numbers be express'dMeaning deep, 'neath merry jest.-----

모모TO ORIGINALS.

모모A FELLOW says: "I own no school or college;No master lives whom I acknowledge;And pray don't entertain the thoughtThat from the dead I e'er learnt aught."This, if I rightly understand,Means: "I'm a blockhead at first hand."

모모1815.-----THE SOLDIER'S CONSOLATION.

모모No! in truth there's here no lack:White the bread, the maidens black!To another town, next night:Black the bread, the maidens white!

모모1815.*-----GENIAL IMPULSE.

모모THUS roll I, never taking ease,My tub, like Saint Diogenes,Now serious am, now seek to please;Now love and hate in turn one sees;The motives now are those, now these;Now nothings, now realities.Thus roll I, never taking ease,My tub, like Saint Diogenes.

모모1810.-----NEITHER THIS NOR THAT.

모모IF thou to be a slave shouldst will,Thou'lt get no pity, but fare ill;And if a master thou wouldst be,The world will view it angrily;And if in statu quo thou stay,That thou art but a fool, they'll say.

모모1815.*-----THE WAY TO BEHAVE.

모모THOUGH tempers are bad and peevish folks swear,Remember to ruffle thy brows, friend, ne'er;And let not the fancies of women so fairE'er serve thy pleasure in life to impair.

모모1815.*-----THE BEST.

모모WHEN head and heart are busy, say,

모모What better can be found?Who neither loves nor goes astray,

모모Were better under ground.

모모1815.*-----AS BROAD AS IT'S LONG.

모모MODEST men must needs endure,

모모And the bold must humbly bow;Thus thy fate's the same, be sure,

모모Whether bold or modest thou.

모모1815.*-----THE RULE OF LIFE.

모모IF thou wouldst live unruffled by care,Let not the past torment thee e'er;As little as possible be thou annoy'd,And let the present be ever enjoy'd;Ne'er let thy breast with hate be supplied,And to God the future confide.

모모1815.*-----THE SAME, EXPANDED.

모모IF thou wouldst live unruffled by care,Let not the past torment thee e'er;If any loss thou hast to rue,Act as though thou wert born anew;Inquire the meaning of each day,What each day means itself will say;In thine own actions take thy pleasure,What others do, thou'lt duly treasure;Ne'er let thy breast with hate be supplied,And to God the future confide.

모모-----

모모IF wealth is gone--then something is gone!

모모Quick, make up thy mind,

모모And fresh wealth find.If honour is gone--then much is gone!

모모Seek glory to find,

모모And people then will alter their mind.If courage is gone--then all is gone!'Twere better that thou hadst never been born.

모모-----

모모HE who with life makes sport,

모모Can prosper never;Who rules himself in nought,

모모Is a slave ever.

모모MAY each honest effort be

모모Crown'd with lasting constancy.

모모-----

모모EACH road to the proper endRuns straight on, without a bend.

모모1825.-----CALM AT SEA.

모모SILENCE deep rules o'er the waters,

모모Calmly slumb'ring lies the main,While the sailor views with trouble

모모Nought but one vast level plain.

모모Not a zephyr is in motion!

모모Silence fearful as the grave!In the mighty waste of ocean

모모Sunk to rest is ev'ry wave.

모모1795.-----THE PROSPEROUS VOYAGE.

모모THE mist is fast clearing.And radiant is heaven,Whilst AEolus loosensOur anguish-fraught bond.The zephyrs are sighing,Alert is the sailor.Quick! nimbly be plying!The billows are riven,The distance approaches;I see land beyond!

모모1795.-----COURAGE.

모모CARELESSLY over the plain away,Where by the boldest man no pathCut before thee thou canst discern,Make for thyself a path!

모모Silence, loved one, my heart!Cracking, let it not break!Breaking, break not with thee!

모모1776.*-----MY ONLY PROPERTY.

모모I FEEL that I'm possess'd of nought,Saving the free unfetterd thought

모모Which from my bosom seeks to flow,And each propitious passing hourThat suffers me in all its power

모모A loving fate with truth to know.

모모1814.-----ADMONITION.

모모WHEREFORE ever ramble on?

모모For the Good is lying near,Fortune learn to seize alone,

모모For that Fortune's ever here.

모모1789.-----OLD AGE.

모모OLD age is courteous--no one more:For time after time he knocks at the door,But nobody says, "Walk in, sir, pray!"Yet turns he not from the door away,But lifts the latch, and enters with speed.And then they cry "A cool one, indeed!"

모모1814.-----EPITAPH.

모모As a boy, reserved and naughty;As a youth, a coxcomb and haughty;As a man, for action inclined;As a greybeard, fickle in mind.--Upon thy grave will people read:This was a very man, indeed!

모모1815.*-----RULES FOR MONARCHS.

모모IF men are never their thoughts to employ,Take care to provide them a life full of joy;But if to some profit and use thou wouldst bend them,Take care to shear them, and then defend them.

모모1815.*-----PAULO POST FUTURI.

모모WEEP ye not, ye children dear,

모모That as yet ye are unborn:For each sorrow and each tear

모모Makes the father's heart to mourn.

모모Patient be a short time to it,

모모Unproduced, and known to none;If your father cannot do it,

모모By your mother 'twill be done.

모모1784.-----THE FOOL'S EPILOGUE.

모모MANY good works I've done and ended,Ye take the praise--I'm not offended;For in the world, I've always thoughtEach thing its true position hath sought.When praised for foolish deeds am I,I set off laughing heartily;When blamed for doing something good,I take it in an easy mood.If some one stronger gives me hard blows,That it's a jest, I feign to suppose:But if 'tis one that's but my own like,I know the way such folks to strike.When Fortune smiles, I merry grow,And sing in dulci jubilo;When sinks her wheel, and tumbles me o'er,I think 'tis sure to rise once more.

모모In the sunshine of summer I ne'er lament,Because the winter it cannot prevent;And when the white snow-flakes fall around,I don my skates, and am off with a bound.Though I dissemble as I will,The sun for me will ne'er stand still;The old and wonted course is run,Until the whole of life is done;Each day the servant like the lord,In turns comes home, and goes abroad;If proud or humble the line they take,They all must eat, drink, sleep, and wake.So nothing ever vexes me;Act like the fool, and wise ye'll be!

모모1804.-----

모모PARABLES.

모모-----Joy from that in type we borrow,Which in life gives only sorrow.-----JOY.

모모A DRAGON-FLY with beauteous wingIs hov'ring o'er a silv'ry spring;I watch its motions with delight,--Now dark its colours seem, now bright;Chameleon-like appear, now blue,Now red, and now of greenish hue.Would it would come still nearer me,That I its tints might better see

모모It hovers, flutters, resting ne'er!

모모But hush! it settles on the mead.I have it safe now, I declare!

모모And when its form I closely view,

모모'Tis of a sad and dingy blue--Such, Joy-Dissector, is thy case indeed

모모1767-9.-----EXPLANATION OF AN ANTIQUE GEM,

모모A YOUNG fig-tree its form lifts high

모모Within a beauteous garden;And see, a goat is sitting by.

모모As if he were its warden.

모모But oh, Quirites, how one errs!

모모The tree is guarded badly;For round the other side there whirrs

모모And hums a beetle madly.

모모The hero with his well-mail'd coat

모모Nibbles the branches tall so;A mighty longing feels the goat

모모Gently to climb up also.

모모And so, my friends, ere long ye see

모모The tree all leafless standing;It looks a type of misery,

모모Help of the gods demanding.

모모Then listen, ye ingenuous youth,

모모Who hold wise saws respected:From he-goat and from beetles-tooth

모모A tree should be protected!

모모1815.-----CAT-PIE.

모모WHILE he is mark'd by vision clear

모모Who fathoms Nature's treasures,The man may follow, void of fear,

모모Who her proportions measures.

모모Though for one mortal, it is true,

모모These trades may both be fitted,Yet, that the things themselves are two

모모Must always be admitted.

모모Once on a time there lived a cook

모모Whose skill was past disputing,Who in his head a fancy took

모모To try his luck at shooting.

모모So, gun in hand, he sought a spot

모모Where stores of game were breeding,And there ere long a cat he shot

모모That on young birds was feeding.

모모This cat he fancied was a hare,

모모Forming a judgment hasty,So served it up for people's fare,

모모Well-spiced and in a pasty.

모모Yet many a guest with wrath was fill'd

모모(All who had noses tender):The cat that's by the sportsman kill'd

모모No cook a hare can render.

모모1810.-----LEGEND.

모모THERE lived in the desert a holy man

모모To whom a goat-footed Faun one dayPaid a visit, and thus began

모모To his surprise: "I entreat thee to prayThat grace to me and my friends may be given,That we may be able to mount to Heaven,For great is our thirst for heav'nly bliss."The holy man made answer to this:"Much danger is lurking in thy petition,Nor will it be easy to gain admission;Thou dost not come with an angel's salute;For I see thou wearest a cloven foot."The wild man paused, and then answer'd he:"What doth my goat's foot matter to thee?Full many I've known into heaven to passStraight and with ease, with the head of an ass!"

모모1815.*-----AUTHORS.

모모OVER the meadows, and down the stream,

모모And through the garden-walks straying,He plucks the flowers that fairest seem;

모모His throbbing heart brooks no delaying.His maiden then comes--oh, what ecstasy!Thy flowers thou giv'st for one glance of her eye!

모모The gard'ner next door o'er the hedge sees the youth:"I'm not such a fool as that, in good truth;My pleasure is ever to cherish each flower,And see that no birds my fruit e'er devour.But when 'tis ripe, your money, good neighbour!'Twas not for nothing I took all this labour!"And such, methinks, are the author-tribe.

모모The one his pleasures around him strews,

모모That his friends, the public, may reap, if they choose;The other would fain make them all subscribe,

모모1776.*-----THE CRITIC.

모모I HAD a fellow as my guest,Not knowing he was such a pest,And gave him just my usual fare;He ate his fill of what was there,

모모And for desert my best things swallow'd,Soon as his meal was o'er, what follow'd?Led by the Deuce, to a neighbour he went,And talk'd of my food to his heart's content:"The soup might surely have had more spice,The meat was ill-brown'd, and the wine wasn't nice."A thousand curses alight on his head!'Tis a critic, I vow! Let the dog be struck dead!

모모1776.*-----THE DILETTANTE AND THE CRITIC.

모모A BOY a pigeon once possess'd,In gay and brilliant plumage dress'd;He loved it well, and in boyish sportIts food to take from his mouth he taught,And in his pigeon he took such pride,That his joy to others he needs must confide.

모모An aged fox near the place chanc'd to dwell,Talkative, clever, and learned as well;The boy his society used to prize,Hearing with pleasure his wonders and lies.

모모"My friend the fox my pigeon must seeHe ran, and stretch'd 'mongst the bushes lay he"Look, fox, at my pigeon, my pigeon so fair!His equal I'm sure thou hast look'd upon ne'er!"

모모"Let's see!"--The boy gave it.--"'Tis really not bad;And yet, it is far from complete, I must add.The feathers, for, instance, how short! 'Tis absurd!"So he set to work straightway to pluck the poor bird.

모모The boy screamed.--"Thou must now stronger pinions supply,Or else 'twill be ugly, unable to fly."--Soon 'twas stripp'd--oh, the villain!--and torn all to pieces.The boy was heart-broken,--and so my tale ceases.

모모*         *         *         *

모모He who sees in the boy shadow'd forth his own case,Should be on his guard 'gainst the fox's whole race.

모모1776.*-----THE WRANGLER.

모모ONE day a shameless and impudent wightWent into a shop full of steel wares bright,Arranged with art upon ev'ry shelf.He fancied they were all meant for himself;And so, while the patient owner stood by,The shining goods needs must handle and try,And valued,--for how should a fool better know?--The bad things high, and the good ones low,And all with an easy self-satisfied face;Then, having bought nothing, he left the place.

모모The tradesman now felt sorely vex'd,So when the fellow went there next,A lock of steel made quite red hot.The other cried upon the spot:"Such wares as these, who'd ever buy?the steel is tarnish'd shamefully,"--Then pull'd it, like a fool about,But soon set up a piteous shout."Pray what's the matter?" the shopman spoke;The other scream'd: "Faith, a very cool joke!"

모모1815.*-----THE YELPERS.

모모OUR rides in all directions bend,

모모For business or for pleasure,Yet yelpings on our steps attend,

모모And barkings without measure.The dog that in our stable dwells,

모모After our heels is striding,And all the while his noisy yells

모모But show that we are riding.

모모1815.*-----THE STORK'S VOCATION.

모모THE stork who worms and frogs devours

모모That in our ponds reside,Why should he dwell on high church-towers,

모모With which he's not allied?

모모Incessantly he chatters there,

모모And gives our ears no rest;But neither old nor young can dare

모모To drive him from his nest.

모모I humbly ask it,--how can he

모모Give of his title proof,Save by his happy tendency

모모To soil the church's roof?-----CELEBRITY.

모모[A satire on his own Sorrows of Werther.]

모모ON bridges small and bridges greatStands Nepomucks in ev'ry state,Of bronze, wood, painted, or of stone,Some small as dolls, some giants grown;Each passer must worship before Nepomuck,Who to die on a bridge chanced to have the ill luck,When once a man with head and earsA saint in people's eyes appears,Or has been sentenced piteouslyBeneath the hangman's hand to die,He's as a noted person prized,In portrait is immortalized.Engravings, woodcuts, are supplied,And through the world spread far and wide.Upon them all is seen his name,And ev'ry one admits his claim;Even the image of the LordIs not with greater zeal ador'd.Strange fancy of the human race!Half sinner frail, half child of graceWe see HERR WERTHER of the storyIn all the pomp of woodcut glory.His worth is first made duly known,By having his sad features shownAt ev'ry fair the country round;In ev'ry alehouse too they're found.His stick is pointed by each dunce"The ball would reach his brain at once!"And each says, o'er his beer and bread:"Thank Heav'n that 'tis not we are dead!"

모모1815.*-----PLAYING AT PRIESTS.

모모WITHIN a town where parityAccording to old form we see,--That is to say, where CatholicAnd Protestant no quarrels pick,And where, as in his father's day,Each worships God in his own way,We Luth'ran children used to dwell,By songs and sermons taught as well.The Catholic clingclang in truthSounded more pleasing to our youth,For all that we encounter'd there,To us seem'd varied, joyous, fair.As children, monkeys, and mankindTo ape each other are inclin'd,We soon, the time to while away,A game at priests resolved to play.Their aprons all our sisters lentFor copes, which gave us great content;And handkerchiefs, embroider'd o'er,Instead of stoles we also wore;Gold paper, whereon beasts were traced,The bishop's brow as mitre graced.

모모Through house and garden thus in stateWe strutted early, strutted late,Repeating with all proper unction,Incessantly each holy function.The best was wanting to the game;

모모We knew that a sonorous ring

모모Was here a most important thing;But Fortune to our rescue came,For on the ground a halter lay;

모모We were delighted, and at once

모모Made it a bellrope for the nonce,And kept it moving all the day;

모모In turns each sister and each brother

모모Acted as sexton to another;All help'd to swell the joyous throng;

모모The whole proceeded swimmingly,

모모And since no actual bell had we,We all in chorus sang, Ding dong!

모모*      *      *      *      *

모모Our guileless child's-sport long was hush'd

모모In memory's tomb, like some old lay;And yet across my mind it rush'd

모모With pristine force the other day.The New-Poetic CatholicsIn ev'ry point its aptness fix!

모모1815.*-----SONGS.

모모SONGS are like painted window-panes!In darkness wrapp'd the church remains,If from the market-place we view it;Thus sees the ignoramus through it.No wonder that he deems it tame,--And all his life 'twill be the same.

모모But let us now inside repair,And greet the holy Chapel there!At once the whole seems clear and bright,Each ornament is bathed in light,And fraught with meaning to the sight.God's children! thus your fortune prize,Be edified, and feast your eyes!

모모1827.*-----POETRY.

모모GOD to his untaught children sent

모모Law, order, knowledge, art, from high,And ev'ry heav'nly favour lent,

모모The world's hard lot to qualify.They knew not how they should behave,

모모For all from Heav'n stark-naked came;But Poetry their garments gave,

모모And then not one had cause for shame.

모모1816.-----A PARABLE.

모모I PICKED a rustic nosegay lately,And bore it homewards, musing greatly;When, heated by my hand, I foundThe heads all drooping tow'rd the ground.I plac'd them in a well-cool'd glass,And what a wonder came to passThe heads soon raised themselves once more.The stalks were blooming as before,And all were in as good a caseAs when they left their native place.

모모*      *      *      *

모모So felt I, when I wond'ring heardMy song to foreign tongues transferr'd.

모모1828.-----SHOULD E'ER THE LOVELESS DAY.

모모SHOULD e'er the loveless day remainObscured by storms of hail and rain,

모모Thy charms thou showest never;I tap at window, tap at door:Come, lov'd one, come! appear once more!

모모Thou art as fair as ever!

모모1827.*-----A PLAN THE MUSES ENTERTAINED.

모모A PLAN the Muses entertain'd

모모Methodically to impart

모모To Psyche the poetic art;Prosaic-pure her soul remain'd.No wondrous sounds escaped her lyre

모모E'en in the fairest Summer night;But Amor came with glance of fire,--

모모The lesson soon was learn'd aright.

모모1827.*-----THE DEATH OF THE FLY.

모모WITH eagerness he drinks the treach'rous potion,

모모Nor stops to rest, by the first taste misled;Sweet is the draught, but soon all power of motion

모모He finds has from his tender members fled;No longer has he strength to plume his wing,No longer strength to raise his head, poor thing!E'en in enjoyment's hour his life he loses,His little foot to bear his weight refuses;So on he sips, and ere his draught is o'er,Death veils his thousand eyes for evermore.

모모1810.-----BY THE RIVER.

모모WHEN by the broad stream thou dost dwell,

모모Oft shallow is its sluggish flood;Then, when thy fields thou tendest well,

모모It o'er them spreads its slime and mud.

모모The ships descend ere daylight wanes,

모모The prudent fisher upward goes;Round reef and rock ice casts its chains,

모모And boys at will the pathway close.

모모To this attend, then, carefully,

모모And what thou wouldst, that execute!Ne'er linger, ne'er o'erhasty be,

모모For time moves on with measured foot.

모모1821.*-----THE FOX AND CRANE.

모모ONCE two persons uninvited

모모Came to join my dinner table;For the nonce they lived united,

모모Fox and crane yclept in fable.

모모Civil greetings pass'd between us

모모Then I pluck'd some pigeons tenderFor the fox of jackal-genius,

모모Adding grapes in full-grown splendour.

모모Long-neck'd flasks I put as dishes

모모For the crane, without delaying,Fill'd with gold and silver fishes,

모모In the limpid water playing.

모모Had ye witness'd Reynard planted

모모At his flat plate, all demurely,Ye with envy must have granted:

모모"Ne'er was such a gourmand, surely!"

모모While the bird with circumspection

모모On one foot, as usual, cradled,From the flasks his fish-refection

모모With his bill and long neck ladled.

모모One the pigeons praised,--the other,

모모As they went, extoll'd the fishes,Each one scoffing at his brother

모모For preferring vulgar dishes.

모모*        *        *

모모If thou wouldst preserve thy credit,

모모When thou askest folks to guzzleAt thy hoard, take care to spread it

모모Suited both for bill and muzzle.

모모1819.-----THE FOX AND HUNTSMAN.

모모HARD 'tis on a fox's traces

모모To arrive, midst forest-glades;Hopeless utterly the chase is,

모모If his flight the huntsman aids.

모모And so 'tis with many a wonder,

모모(Why A B make Ab in fact,)Over which we gape and blunder,

모모And our head and brains distract.

모모1821.*-----THE FROGS.

모모A POOL was once congeal'd with frost;The frogs, in its deep waters lost,

모모No longer dared to croak or spring;But promised, being half asleep,If suffer'd to the air to creep,

모모As very nightingales to sing.

모모A thaw dissolved the ice so strong,--They proudly steer'd themselves along,When landed, squatted on the shore,And croak'd as loudly as before.

모모1821.*-----THE WEDDING.

모모A FEAST was in a village spread,--It was a wedding-day, they said.The parlour of the inn I found,And saw the couples whirling round,Each lass attended by her lad,And all seem'd loving, blithe, and glad;

모모But on my asking for the bride,A fellow with a stare, replied:"'Tis not the place that point to raise!

모모We're only dancing in her honour;We now have danced three nights and days,

모모And not bestowed one thought upon her."

모모*      *      *      *

모모Whoe'er in life employs his eyesSuch cases oft will recognise.

모모1821.*-----BURIAL.

모모To the grave one day from a house they bore

모모A maiden;To the window the citizens went to explore;In splendour they lived, and with wealth as of yore

모모Their banquets were laden.Then thought they: "The maid to the tomb is now borne;We too from our dwellings ere long must be torn,And he that is left our departure to mourn,

모모To our riches will be the successor,

모모For some one must be their possessor.

모모1827.*-----THREATENING SIGNS.

모모IF Venus in the evening skyIs seen in radiant majesty,If rod-like comets, red as blood,Are 'mongst the constellations view'd,Out springs the Ignoramus, yelling:"The star's exactly o'er my dwelling!What woeful prospect, ah, for me!Then calls his neighbour mournfully:"Behold that awful sign of evil,Portending woe to me, poor devil!My mother's asthma ne'er will leave her,My child is sick with wind and fever;I dread the illness of my wife,A week has pass'd, devoid of strife,--And other things have reach'd my ear;The Judgment Day has come, I fear!"

모모His neighbour answered: "Friend, you're right!Matters look very had to-night.Let's go a street or two, though, hence,And gaze upon the stars from thence."--No change appears in either case.Let each remain then in his place,And wisely do the best he can,Patient as any other man.

모모1821.*-----THE BUYERS.

모모To an apple-woman's stall

모모Once some children nimbly ran;Longing much to purchase all,They with joyous haste beganSnatching up the piles there raised,While with eager eyes they gazedOn the rosy fruit so nice;But when they found out the price,Down they threw the whole they'd got,Just as if they were red hot.

모모*      *      *      *      *

모모The man who gratis will his goods supplyWill never find a lack of folks to buy!

모모1820.-----THE MOUNTAIN VILLAGE.

모모"THE mountain village was destroy'd;But see how soon is fill'd the void!Shingles and boards, as by magic arise,The babe in his cradle and swaddling-clothes lies;How blest to trust to God's protection!"

모모Behold a wooden new erection,So that, if sparks and wind but choose,God's self at such a game must lose!

모모PALM Sunday at the Vatican

모모They celebrate with palms;With reverence bows each holy man,

모모And chaunts the ancient psalms.Those very psalms are also sung

모모With olive boughs in hand,While holly, mountain wilds among,

모모In place of palms must stand:In fine, one seeks some twig that's green,

모모And takes a willow rod,So that the pious man may e'en

모모In small things praise his God.

모모And if ye have observed it well,

모모To gain what's fit ye're able,If ye in faith can but excel;

모모Such are the myths of fable.

모모1827.*-----THREE PALINODIAS.

모모I.

모모"Incense is hut a tribute for the gods,--To mortals 'tis but poison."

모모THE smoke that from thine altar blows,

모모Can it the gods offend?For I observe thou hold'st thy nose--

모모Pray what does this portend?Mankind deem incense to excel

모모Each other earthly thing,So he that cannot bear its smell,

모모No incense e'er should bring.

모모With unmoved face by thee at least

모모To dolls is homage given;If not obstructed by the priest,

모모The scent mounts up to heaven.

모모1827.*

모모II

모모CONFLICT OF WIT AND BEAUTY.

모모SIR Wit, who is so much esteem'd,

모모And who is worthy of all honour,Saw Beauty his superior deem'd

모모By folks who loved to gaze upon her;At this he was most sorely vex'd.

모모Then came Sir Breath (long known as fit

모모To represent the cause of wit),

모모Beginning, rudely, I admit,To treat the lady with a text.To this she hearken'd not at all,But hasten'd to his principal:"None are so wise, they say, as you,--Is not the world enough for two?

모모If you are obstinate, good-bye!If wise, to love me you will try,For be assured the world can ne'erGive birth to a more handsome pair."

모모1827.*

모모=====

모모FAIR daughters were by Beauty rear'd,

모모Wit had but dull sons for his lot;So for a season it appear'd

모모Beauty was constant, Wit was not.But Wit's a native of the soil,

모모So he return'd, work'd, strove amain,And found--sweet guerdon for his toil!--

모모Beauty to quicken him again.

모모1827.*

모모III.

모모RAIN AND RAINBOW.

모모DURING a heavy storm it chancedThat from his room a cockney glancedAt the fierce tempest as it broke,While to his neighbour thus he spoke:"The thunder has our awe inspired,Our barns by lightning have been fired,--Our sins to punish, I suppose;But in return, to soothe our woes,See how the rain in torrents fell,Making the harvest promise well!But is't a rainbow that I spyExtending o'er the dark-grey sky?With it I'm sure we may dispense,The colour'd cheat! The vain pretence!"Dame Iris straightway thus replied:"Dost dare my beauty to deride?In realms of space God station'd meA type of better worlds to beTo eyes that from life's sorrows roveIn cheerful hope to Heav'n above,And, through the mists that hover hereGod and his precepts blest revere.Do thou, then, grovel like the swine,And to the ground thy snout confine,But suffer the enlighten'd eyeTo feast upon my majesty."

모모1827.*

모모VALEDICTION.

모모I ONCE was fond of fools,

모모And bid them come each day;Then each one brought his tools

모모The carpenter to play;The roof to strip first choosing,

모모Another to supply,The wood as trestles using,

모모To move it by-and-by,While here and there they ran,

모모And knock'd against each other;To fret I soon began,

모모My anger could not smother,So cried, "Get out, ye fools!"

모모At this they were offendedThen each one took his tools,

모모And so our friendship ended.

모모Since that, I've wiser been,

모모And sit beside my door;When one of them is seen,

모모I cry, "Appear no more!""Hence, stupid knave!" I bellow:

모모At this he's angry too:"You impudent old fellow!

모모And pray, sir, who are you?Along the streets we riot,

모모And revel at the fair;But yet we're pretty quiet,

모모And folks revile us ne'er.Don't call us names, then, please!"--At length I meet with ease,

모모For now they leave my door--'Tis better than before!

모모1827.*-----THE COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTER.

모모I.

모모A MASTER of a country schoolJump'd up one day from off his stool,Inspired with firm resolve to tryTo gain the best society;So to the nearest baths he walk'd,And into the saloon he stalk'd.He felt quite. startled at the door,Ne'er having seen the like before.To the first stranger made he nowA very low and graceful bow,But quite forgot to bear in mindThat people also stood behind;His left-hand neighbor's paunch he struckA grievous blow, by great ill luck;Pardon for this he first entreated,And then in haste his bow repeated.His right hand neighbor next he hit,And begg'd him, too, to pardon it;But on his granting his petition,Another was in like condition;These compliments he paid to all,Behind, before, across the hall;At length one who could stand no more,Show'd him impatiently the door.

모모*      *      *      *

모모May many, pond'ring on their crimes,A moral draw from this betimes!

모모II.

모모As he proceeded on his wayHe thought, "I was too weak to-day;To bow I'll ne'er again be seen;For goats will swallow what is green."Across the fields he now must speed,Not over stumps and stones, indeed,But over meads and cornfields sweet,Trampling down all with clumsy feet.A farmer met him by-and-by,And didn't ask him: how? or why?But with his fist saluted him.

모모"I feel new life in every limb!"Our traveller cried in ecstasy."Who art thou who thus gladden'st me?May Heaven such blessings ever send!Ne'er may I want a jovial friend!"

모모1808.*-----THE LEGEND OF THE HORSESHOE.

모모WHAT time our Lord still walk'd the earth,Unknown, despised, of humble birth,And on Him many a youth attended(His words they seldom comprehended),It ever seem'd to Him most meetTo hold His court in open street,As under heaven's broad canopyOne speaks with greater liberty.The teachings of His blessed wordFrom out His holy mouth were heard;Each market to a fane turn'd HeWith parable and simile.

모모One day, as tow'rd a town He roved,In peace of mind with those He loved,Upon the path a something gleam'd;A broken horseshoe 'twas, it seem'd.So to St. Peter thus He spake:"That piece of iron prythee take!"St. Peter's thoughts had gone astray,--He had been musing on his wayRespecting the world's government,A dream that always gives content,For in the head 'tis check'd by nought;This ever was his dearest thought,For him this prize was far too meanHad it a crown and sceptre been!But, surely, 'twasn't worth the troubleFor half a horseshoe to bend double!And so he turn'd away his head,As if he heard not what was said,

모모The Lord, forbearing tow'rd all men,Himself pick'd up the horseshoe then(He ne'er again like this stoop'd down).And when at length they reach'd the town,Before a smithy He remain'd,And there a penny for 't obtain'd.As they the market-place went by,Some beauteous cherries caught His eye:Accordingly He bought as manyAs could be purchased for a penny,And then, as oft His wont had been,Placed them within His sleeve unseen.

모모They went out by another gate,O'er plains and fields proceeding straight,No house or tree was near the spot,The sun was bright, the day was hot;In short, the weather being such,A draught of water was worth much.The Lord walk'd on before them all,And let, unseen, a cherry fall.St. Peter rush'd to seize it hold,As though an apple 'twere of gold;His palate much approv'd the berry;The Lord ere long another cherryOnce more let fall upon the plain;St. Peter forthwith stoop'd again.The Lord kept making him thus bendTo pick up cherries without end.For a long time the thing went on;The Lord then said, in cheerful tone:"Had'st thou but moved when thou wert bid,Thou of this trouble had'st been rid;The man who small things scorns, will next,By things still smaller be perplex'd."

모모".... With mournful majesiyA heap of solitary ruins lie,Half sepulchred in dust, the bankrupt heirTo prodigal antiquity...."-----LOVE AS A LANDSCAPE PAINTER.

모모ON a rocky peak once sat I early,Gazing on the mist with eyes unmoving;Stretch'd out like a pall of greyish texture,All things round, and all above it cover'd.

모모Suddenly a boy appear'd beside me,Saying "Friend, what meanest thou by gazingOn the vacant pall with such composure?Hast thou lost for evermore all pleasureBoth in painting cunningly, and forming?"On the child I gazed, and thought in secret:"Would the boy pretend to be a master?"

모모"Wouldst thou be for ever dull and idle,"Said the boy, "no wisdom thou'lt attain to;See, I'll straightway paint for thee a figure,--How to paint a beauteous figure, show thee."

모모And he then extended his fore-finger,--(Ruddy was it as a youthful rosebud)Tow'rd the broad and far outstretching carpet,And began to draw there with his finger.

모모First on high a radiant sun he painted,Which upon mine eyes with splendour glisten'd,And he made the clouds with golden border,Through the clouds he let the sunbeams enter;Painted then the soft and feathery summitsOf the fresh and quicken'd trees, behind themOne by one with freedom drew the mountains;Underneath he left no lack of water,But the river painted so like Nature,That it seem'd to glitter in the sunbeams,That it seem'd against its banks to murmur.

모모Ah, there blossom'd flowers beside the river,And bright colours gleam'd upon the meadow,Gold, and green, and purple, and enamell'd,All like carbuncles and emeralds seeming!

모모Bright and clear he added then the heavens,And the blue-tinged mountains far and farther,So that I, as though newborn, enrapturedGazed on, now the painter, now the picture.

모모Then spake he: "Although I have convinced theeThat this art I understand full surely,Yet the hardest still is left to show thee."

모모Thereupon he traced, with pointed finger,And with anxious care, upon the forest,At the utmost verge, where the strong sunbeamsFrom the shining ground appear'd reflected,

모모Traced the figure of a lovely maiden,Fair in form, and clad in graceful fashion,Fresh the cheeks beneath her brown locks' ambush,And the cheeks possess'd the selfsame colourAs the finger that had served to paint them.

모모"Oh thou boy!" exclaim'd I then, "what masterIn his school received thee as his pupil,Teaching thee so truthfully and quicklyWisely to begin, and well to finish?"

모모Whilst I still was speaking, lo, a zephyrSoftly rose, and set the tree-tops moving,Curling all the wavelets on the river,And the perfect maiden's veil, too, fill'd it,And to make my wonderment still greater,Soon the maiden set her foot in motion.On she came, approaching tow'rd the stationWhere still sat I with my arch instructor.

모모As now all, yes, all thus moved together,--Flowers, river, trees, the veil,--all moving,--And the gentle foot of that most fair one,Can ye think that on my rock I linger'd,Like a rock, as though fast-chain'd and silent?

모모1816.-----THE METAMORPHOSIS OF PLANTS.

모모THOU art confused, my beloved, at, seeing the thousandfold union

모모Shown in this flowery troop, over the garden dispers'd;any a name dost thou hear assign'd; one after another

모모Falls on thy list'ning ear, with a barbarian sound.None resembleth another, yet all their forms have a likeness;

모모Therefore, a mystical law is by the chorus proclaim'd;Yes, a sacred enigma! Oh, dearest friend, could I only

모모Happily teach thee the word, which may the mystery solve!Closely observe how the plant, by little and little progressing,

모모Step by step guided on, changeth to blossom and fruit!First from the seed it unravels itself, as soon as the silent

모모Fruit-bearing womb of the earth kindly allows Its escape,And to the charms of the light, the holy, the ever-in-motion,

모모Trusteth the delicate leaves, feebly beginning to shoot.Simply slumber'd the force in the seed; a germ of the future,

모모Peacefully lock'd in itself, 'neath the integument lay,Leaf and root, and bud, still void of colour, and shapeless;

모모Thus doth the kernel, while dry, cover that motionless life.Upward then strives it to swell, in gentle moisture confiding,

모모And, from the night where it dwelt, straightway ascendeth to light.Yet still simple remaineth its figure, when first it appeareth;

모모And 'tis a token like this, points out the child 'mid the plants.Soon a shoot, succeeding it, riseth on high, and reneweth,

모모Piling-up node upon node, ever the primitive form;Yet not ever alike: for the following leaf, as thou seest,

모모Ever produceth itself, fashioned in manifold ways.Longer, more indented, in points and in parts more divided,

모모Which. all-deform'd until now, slept in the organ below,So at length it attaineth the noble and destined perfection,

모모Which, in full many a tribe, fills thee with wondering awe.Many ribb'd and tooth'd, on a surface juicy and swelling,

모모Free and unending the shoot seemeth in fullness to be;Yet here Nature restraineth, with powerful hands, the formation,

모모And to a perfecter end, guideth with softness its growth,Less abundantly yielding the sap, contracting the vessels,

모모So that the figure ere long gentler effects doth disclose.Soon and in silence is check'd the growth of the vigorous branches,

모모And the rib of the stalk fuller becometh in form.Leafless, however, and quick the tenderer stem then up-springeth,

모모And a miraculous sight doth the observer enchant.Ranged in a circle, in numbers that now are small, and now countless,

모모Gather the smaller-sized leaves, close by the side of their like.Round the axis compress'd the sheltering calyx unfoldeth,

모모And, as the perfectest type, brilliant-hued coronals forms.Thus doth Nature bloom, in glory still nobler and fuller,

모모Showing, in order arranged, member on member uprear'd.Wonderment fresh dost thou feel, as soon as the stem rears the flower

모모Over the scaffolding frail of the alternating leaves.But this glory is only the new creation's foreteller,

모모Yes, the leaf with its hues feeleth the hand all divine,And on a sudden contracteth itself; the tenderest figures

모모Twofold as yet, hasten on, destined to blend into one.Lovingly now the beauteous pairs are standing together,

모모Gather'd in countless array, there where the altar is raised.Hymen hovereth o'er them, and scents delicious and mighty

모모Stream forth their fragrance so sweet, all things enliv'ning around.Presently, parcell'd out, unnumber'd germs are seen swelling,

모모Sweetly conceald in the womb, where is made perfect the fruit.Here doth Nature close the ring of her forces eternal;

모모Yet doth a new one, at once, cling to the one gone before,So that the chain be prolonged for ever through all generations,

모모And that the whole may have life, e'en as enjoy'd by each part.Now, my beloved one, turn thy gaze on the many-hued thousands

모모Which, confusing no more, gladden the mind as they wave.Every plant unto thee proclaimeth the laws everlasting,

모모Every flowered speaks louder and louder to thee;But if thou here canst decipher the mystic words of the goddess,

모모Everywhere will they be seen, e'en though the features are changed.Creeping insects may linger, the eager butterfly hasten,--

모모Plastic and forming, may man change e'en the figure decreed!Oh, then, bethink thee, as well, how out of the germ of acquaintance,

모모Kindly intercourse sprang, slowly unfolding its leaves;Soon how friendship with might unveil'd itself in our bosoms,

모모And how Amor, at length, brought forth blossom and fruitThink of the manifold ways wherein Nature hath lent to our feelings,

모모Silently giving them birth, either the first or the last!Yes, and rejoice in the present day! For love that is holy

모모Seeketh the noblest of fruits,--that where the thoughts are the same,Where the opinions agree,--that the pair may, in rapt contemplation,

모모Lovingly blend into one,--find the more excellent world.

모모THE Epigrams bearing the title of XENIA were written by Goetheand Schiller together, having been first occasioned by someviolent attacks made on them by some insignificant writers. Theyare extremely numerous, but scarcely any of them could betranslated into English. Those here given are merely presented asa specimen.

모모RELIGION AND CHURCH.

모모-----THOUGHTS ON JESUS CHRIST'S DESCENT INTO HELL.

모모[THE remarkable Poem of which this is a literal but faintrepresentation, was written when Goethe was only sixteen yearsold. It derives additional interest from the fact of its beingthe very earliest piece of his that is preserved. The few otherpieces included by Goethe under the title of Religion and Churchare polemical, and devoid of interest to the English reader.]

모모WHAT wondrous noise is heard around!Through heaven exulting voices sound,

모모A mighty army marches onBy thousand millions follow'd, lo,To yon dark place makes haste to go

모모God's Son, descending from His throne!He goes--the tempests round Him break,

모모As Judge and Hero cometh He;He goes--the constellations quake,

모모The sun, the world quake fearfully.

모모I see Him in His victor-car,On fiery axles borne afar,

모모Who on the cross for us expired.The triumph to yon realms He shows,--Remote from earth, where star ne'er glows,

모모The triumph He for us acquired.He cometh, Hell to extirpate,

모모Whom He, by dying, wellnigh kill'd;He shall pronounce her fearful fate

모모Hark! now the curse is straight fulfill'd.

모모Hell sees the victor come at last,She feels that now her reign is past,

모모She quakes and fears to meet His sight;She knows His thunders' terrors dread,In vain she seeks to hide her head,

모모Attempts to fly, but vain is flight;Vainly she hastes to 'scape pursuit

모모And to avoid her Judge's eye;The Lord's fierce wrath restrains her foot

모모Like brazen chains,--she cannot fly.

모모Here lies the Dragon, trampled down,He lies, and feels God's angry frown,

모모He feels, and grinneth hideously;He feels Hell's speechless agonies,A thousand times he howls and sighs:

모모"Oh, burning flames! quick, swallow me!"There lies he in the fiery waves,

모모By torments rack'd and pangs infernal,Instant annihilation craves,

모모And hears, those pangs will be eternal.

모모Those mighty squadrons, too, are here,The partners of his cursed career,

모모Yet far less bad than he were they.Here lies the countless throng combined,In black and fearful crowds entwined,

모모While round him fiery tempests play;He sees how they the Judge avoid,

모모He sees the storm upon them feed,Yet is not at the sight o'erjoy'd,

모모Because his pangs e'en theirs exceed.

모모The Son of Man in triumph passesDown to Hell's wild and black morasses,

모모And there unfolds His majesty.Hell cannot bear the bright array,For, since her first created day.

모모Darkness alone e'er govern'd she.She lay remote from ev'ry light

모모With torments fill'd in Chaos here;God turn'd for ever from her sight

모모His radiant features' glory clear.

모모Within the realms she calls her own,She sees the splendour of the Son,

모모His dreaded glories shining forth;She sees Him clad in rolling thunder,She sees the rocks all quake with wonder,

모모When God before her stands in wrath.She sees He comes her Judge to be,

모모She feels the awful pangs inside her,Herself to slay endeavours she,

모모But e'en this comfort is denied her.

모모Now looks she back, with pains untold,Upon those happy times of old,

모모When those glories gave her joy;When yet her heart revered the truth,When her glad soul, in endless youth

모모And rapture dwelt, without alloy.She calls to mind with madden'd thought

모모How over man her wiles prevail'd;To take revenge on God she sought,

모모And feels the vengeance it entail'd.

모모God was made man, and came to earth.Then Satan cried with fearful mirth:

모모"E'en He my victim now shall be!"He sought to slay the Lord Most High,The world's Creator now must die;

모모But, Satan, endless woe to thee!Thou thought'st to overcome Him then,

모모Rejoicing in His suffering;But he in triumph comes again

모모To bind thee: Death! where is thy sting?

모모Speak, Hell! where is thy victory?Thy power destroy'd and scatter'd see!

모모Know'st thou not now the Highest's might?See, Satan, see thy rule o'erthrown!

모모By thousand-varying pangs weigh'd down,Thou dwell'st in dark and endless night.

모모As though by lightning struck thou liest,No gleam of rapture far or wide;

모모In vain! no hope thou there decriest,--For me alone Messiah died!

모모A howling rises through the air,A trembling fills each dark vault there,

모모When Christ to Hell is seen to come.She snarls with rage, but needs must cowerBefore our mighty hero's power;

모모He signs--and Hell is straightway dumb.Before his voice the thunders break,

모모On high His victor-banner blows;E'en angels at His fury quake,

모모When Christ to the dread judgment goes.

모모Now speaks He, and His voice is thunder,He speaks, the rocks are rent in sunder,

모모His breath is like devouring flames.Thus speaks He: "Tremble, ye accurs'd!He who from Eden hurl'd you erst,

모모Your kingdom's overthrow proclaims.Look up! My children once were ye,

모모Your arms against Me then ye turn'd,Ye fell, that ye might sinners be,

모모Ye've now the wages that ye earn'd.

모모"My greatest foeman from that day,Ye led my dearest friends astray,--

모모As ye had fallen, man must fall.To kill him evermore ye sought,'They all shall die the death,' ye thought;

모모But howl! for Me I won them all.For them alone did I descend,

모모For them pray'd, suffer'd, perish'd I.Ye ne'er shall gain your wicked end;

모모Who trusts in Me shall never die.

모모"In endless chains here lie ye now,Nothing can save you from the slough.

모모Not boldness, not regret for crime.Lie, then, and writhe in brimstone fire!'Twas ye yourselves drew down Mine ire,

모모Lie and lament throughout all time!And also ye, whom I selected,

모모E'en ye forever I disown,For ye My saving grace rejected

모모Ye murmur? blame yourselves alone!

모모"Ye might have lived with Me in bliss,For I of yore had promis'd this;

모모Ye sinn'd, and all My precepts slightedWrapp'd in the sleep of sin ye dwelt,Now is My fearful judgment felt,

모모By a just doom your guilt requited."--Thus spake He, and a fearful storm

모모From Him proceeds, the lightnings glow,The thunders seize each wicked form,

모모And hurl them in the gulf below.

모모The God-man closeth Hell's sad doors,In all His majesty He soars

모모From those dark regions back to light.He sitteth at the Father's side;Oh, friends, what joy doth this betide!

모모For us, for us He still will fight!The angels sacred quire around

모모Rejoice before the mighty Lord,So that all creatures hear the sound:

모모"Zebaoth's God be aye ador'd!"

모모ANTIQUES.

모모-----LEOPOLD, DUKE OF BRUNSWICK.

모모[Written on the occasion of the death, by drowning, of thePrince.]

모모THOU wert forcibly seized by the hoary lord of the river,--

모모Holding thee, ever he shares with thee his streaming domain,Calmly sleepest thou near his urn as it silently trickles,

모모Till thou to action art roused, waked by the swift-rolling flood.Kindly be to the people, as when thou still wert a mortal,

모모Perfecting that as a god, which thou didst fail in, as man.

모모1785.-----TO THE HUSBANDMAN.

모모SMOOTHLY and lightly the golden seed by the furrow is cover'd;

모모Yet will a deeper one, friend, cover thy bones at the last.Joyously plough'd and sow'd! Here food all living is budding,

모모E'en from the side of the tomb Hope will not vanish away.

모모1789.*-----ANACREON'S GRAVE.

모모HERE where the roses blossom, where vines round the laurels are twining,

모모Where the turtle-dove calls, where the blithe cricket is heard,Say, whose grave can this be, with life by all the Immortals

모모Beauteously planted and deck'd?--Here doth Anacreon sleepSpring and summer and autumn rejoiced the thrice-happy minstrel,

모모And from the winter this mound kindly hath screen'd him at last.

모모1789.*-----THE BRETHREN.

모모SLUMBER and Sleep, two brethren ordain'd by the gods to their service,

모모Were by Prometheus implored, comfort to give to his race;But though so light to the gods, too heavy for man was their burden,

모모We in their slumber find sleep, we in their sleep meet with death.

모모1789.*-----MEASURE OF TIME.

모모EROS, what mean'st thou by this? In each of thine hands is an hourglass!

모모What, oh thou frivolous god! twofold thy measure of time?"Slowly run from the one, the hours of lovers when parted;

모모While through the other they rush swiftly, as soon as they meet."

모모1789.*-----WARNING.

모모WAKEN not Amor from sleep! The beauteous urchin still slumbers;

모모Go, and complete thou the task, that to the day is assign'd!Thus doth the prudent mother with care turn time to her profit,

모모While her babe is asleep, for 'twill awake but too soon.

모모1785.*-----SOLITUDE.

모모OH ye kindly nymphs, who dwell 'mongst the rocks and the thickets,

모모Grant unto each whatsoe'er he may in silence desire!Comfort impart to the mourner, and give to the doubter instruction,

모모And let the lover rejoice, finding the bliss that he craves.For from the gods ye received what they ever denied unto mortals,

모모Power to comfort and aid all who in you may confide.

모모1782.-----THE CHOSEN CLIFF.

모모HERE in silence the lover fondly mused on his loved one;

모모Gladly he spake to me thus: "Be thou my witness, thou stone!Yet thou must not be vainglorious, thou hast many companions;

모모Unto each rock on the plain, where I, the happy one, dwell,Unto each tree of the wood that I cling to, as onward I ramble,

모모'Be thou a sign of my bliss!' shout I, and then 'tis ordain'd.Yet to thee only I lend a voice, as a Muse from the people

모모Chooseth one for herself, kissing his lips as a friend."

모모1782.-----THE CONSECRATED SPOT.

모모WHEN in the dance of the Nymphs, in the moonlight so holy assembled,

모모Mingle the Graces, down from Olympus in secret descending,Here doth the minstrel hide, and list to their numbers enthralling,

모모Here doth he watch their silent dances' mysterious measure.All that is glorious in Heaven, and all that the earth in her beauty

모모Ever hath brought into life, the dreamer awake sees before him;All he repeats to the Muses, and lest the gods should be anger'd,

모모How to tell of secrets discreetly, the Muses instruct him.

모모1789.*-----THE INSTRUCTORS.

모모WHEN Diogenes quietly sunn'd himself in his barrel,

모모When Calanus with joy leapt in the flame-breathing grave,Oh, what noble lessons were those for the rash son of Philip,

모모Were not the lord of the world e'en for instruction too great!

모모1789.*-----THE UNEQUAL MARRIAGE,

모모EVEN this heavenly pair were unequally match'd when united:

모모Psyche grew older and wise, Amor remain'd still a child,

모모1789.*-----EXCUSE.

모모THOU dost complain of woman for changing from one to another?

모모Censure her not: for she seeks one who will constant remain.

모모1789.*-----SAKONTALA.

모모WOULDST thou the blossoms of spring, as well as the fruits of the autumn,

모모Wouldst thou what charms and delights, wouldst thou what

모모plenteously, feeds,Would thou include both Heaven and earth in one designation,

모모All that is needed is done, when I Sakontala name.

모모1792.-----THE MUSE'S MIRROR.

모모EARLY one day, the Muse, when eagerly bent on adornment,Follow'd a swift-running streamlet, the quietest nook by it seeking.Quickly and noisily flowing, the changeful surface distortedEver her moving form; the goddess departed in anger.Yet the stream call'd mockingly after her, saying: "What, truly!Wilt thou not view, then, the truth, in my mirror so clearly depicted?"But she already was far away, on the brink of the ocean,In her figure rejoicing, and duly arranging her garland.

모모1799.*-----PHOEBUS AND HERMES.

모모DELOS' stately ruler, and Maia's son, the adroit one,

모모Warmly were striving, for both sought the great prize to obtain.Hermes the lyre demanded, the lyre was claim'd by Apollo,

모모Yet were the hearts of the foes fruitlessly nourish'd by hope.For on a sudden Ares burst in, with fury decisive,

모모Dashing in twain the gold toy, brandishing wildly his sword.Hermes, malicious one, laughed beyond measure; yet deep-seated sorrow

모모Seized upon Phoebus's heart, seized on the heart of each Muse.

모모1799.*-----THE NEW AMOR.

모모AMOR, not the child, the youthful lover of Psyche,Look'd round Olympus one day, boldly, to triumph inured;There  he espied a goddess, the fairest amongst the immortals,--Venus Urania she,--straight was his passion inflamed.Even the holy one powerless proved, alas! 'gainst his wooing,--Tightly embraced in his arm, held her the daring one fast.Then from their union arose a new, a more beauteous Amor,Who from his father his wit, grace from his mother derives.Ever thou'lt find him join'd in the kindly Muses' communion,And his charm-laden bolt foundeth the love of the arts.

모모1792.-----THE GARLANDS.

모모KLOPSTOCK would lead us away from Pindus; no longer for laurelMay we be eager--the homely acorn alone must content us;Yet he himself his more-than-epic crusade is conductingHigh on Golgotha's summit, that foreign gods he may honour!Yet, on what hill he prefers, let him gather the angels together,Suffer deserted disciples to weep o'er the grave of the just one:There where a hero and saint hath died, where a bard breath'd his numbers,Both for our life and our death an ensample of courage resplendentAnd of the loftiest human worth to bequeath,--ev'ry nationThere will joyously kneel in devotion ecstatic, reveringThorn and laurel garland, and all its charms and its tortures.

모모1815.*-----THE SWISS ALPS.

모모YESTERDAY brown was still thy head, as the locks of my loved one,

모모Whose sweet image so dear silently beckons afar.Silver-grey is the early snow to-day on thy summit,

모모Through the tempestuous night streaming fast over thy brow.Youth, alas, throughout life as closely to age is united

모모As, in some changeable dream, yesterday blends with to-day.

모모Uri, October 7th, 1797.-----DISTICHS.

모모CHORDS are touch'd by Apollo,--the death-laden bow, too, he bendeth;

모모While he the shepherdess charms, Python he lays in the dust.-----WHAT is merciful censure? To make thy faults appear smaller?

모모May be to veil them? No, no! O'er them to raise thee on high!-----DEMOCRATIC food soon cloys on the multitude's stomach;But I'll wager, ere long, other thou'lt give them instead.-----WHAT in France has pass'd by, the Germans continue to practise,

모모For the proudest of men flatters the people and fawns.-----WHO is the happiest of men? He who values the merits of others,And in their pleasure takes joy, even as though 'twere his own.-----NOT in the morning alone, not only at mid-day he charmeth;

모모Even at setting, the sun is still the same glorious planet.-----

모모VENETIAN EPIGRAMS.(Written in 1790.)-----URN and sarcophagus erst were with life adorn'd by the heathen

모모Fauns are dancing around, while with the Bacchanal troopChequerd circles they trace; and the goat-footed, puffy-cheekd player

모모Wildly produceth hoarse tones out of the clamorous horn.Cymbals and drums resound; we see and we hear, too, the marble.

모모Fluttering bird! oh how sweet tastes the ripe fruit to thy bill!Noise there is none to disturb thee, still less to scare away Amor,

모모Who, in the midst of the throng, learns to delight in his torch.Thus doth fullness overcome death; and the ashes there cover'd

모모Seem, in that silent domain, still to be gladdend with life.Thus may the minstrel's sarcophagus be hereafter surrounded

모모With such a scroll, which himself richly with life has adorn'd.-----CLASP'D in my arms for ever eagerly hold I my mistress,

모모Ever my panting heart throbs wildly against her dear breast,And on her knees forever is leaning my head, while I'm gazing

모모Now  on her sweet-smiling mouth, now on her bright sparkling eyes."Oh thou effeminate!" spake one, "and thus, then, thy days thou

모모art spending?"

모모Ah, they in sorrow are spent. List while I tell thee my tale:Yes! I have left my only joy in life far behind me,

모모Twenty long days hath my car borne me away from her sight.Vettrini defy me, while crafty chamberlains flatter,

모모And the sly Valet de place thinks but of lies and deceit.If I attempt to escape, the Postmaster fastens upon me,

모모Postboys the upper hand get, custom-house duties enrage."Truly, I can't understand thee! thou talkest enigmas! thou seemest

모모Wrapp'd in a blissful repose, glad as Rinaldo of yore:Ah, I  myself understand full well; 'tis my body that travels,

모모And 'tis my spirit that rests still in my mistress's arms.-----I WOULD liken this gondola unto the soft-rocking cradle,

모모And the chest on its deck seems a vast coffin to be.Yes! 'tween the cradle and coffin, we totter and waver for ever

모모On the mighty canal, careless our lifetime is spent.-----WHY are the people thus busily moving? For food they are seeking,

모모Children they fain would beget, feeding them well as they can.Traveller, mark this well, and when thou art home, do thou likewise!

모모More can no mortal effect, work with what ardour he will.-----I WOULD compare to the land this anvil, its lord to the hammer,

모모And to the people the plate, which in the middle is bent.Sad is the poor tin-plate's lot, when the blows are but given at random:

모모Ne'er will the kettle be made, while they uncertainly fall.-----WHAT is the life of a man? Yet thousands are ever accustom'dFreely to talk about man,--what he has done, too, and how.Even less is a poem; yet thousands read and enjoy it,Thousands abuse it.--My friend, live and continue to rhyme!-----MERRY'S the trade of a poet; but somewhat a dear one, I fear me

모모For, as my book grows apace, all of my sequins I lose.-----Is' thou'rt in earnest, no longer delay, but render me happy;Art thou in jest? Ah, sweet love! time for all jesting is past.-----ART thou, then, vex'd at my silence? What shall I speak of? Thou markest

모모Neither my sorrowful sigh, nor my soft eloquent look.Only one goddess is able the seal of my lips to unloosen,--

모모When by Aurora I'm found, slumbering calm on thy breast.Ah, then my hymn in the ears of the earliest gods shall be chaunted,

모모As the Memnonian form breath'd forth sweet secrets in song.-----IN the twilight of morning to climb to the top of the mountain,--

모모Thee to salute, kindly star, earliest herald of day,--And to await, with impatience, the gaze of the ruler of heaven,--

모모Youthful delight, oh oft lur'st thou me out in the night!Oh ye heralds of day, ye heavenly eyes of my mistress,

모모Now ye appear, and the sun evermore riseth too soon.-----THOU art amazed, and dost point to the ocean. It seems to be burning,Flame-crested billows in play dart round our night-moving bark.Me it astonisheth not,--of the ocean was born Aphrodite,--Did not a flame, too, proceed from her for us, in her son?-----GLEAMING the ocean appear'd, the beauteous billows were smiling,

모모While a fresh, favouring wind, filling the sails, drove us on.Free was my bosom from yearning; yet soon my languishing glances

모모Turn'd themselves backward in haste, seeking the snow-cover'd hills.Treasures unnumber'd are southwards lying. Yet one to the northwards

모모Draws me resistlessly back, like the strong magnet in force.-----SPACIOUS and fair is the world; yet oh! how I thank the kind heavens

모모That I a garden possess, small though it be, yet mine own.One which enticeth me homewards; why should a gardener wander?

모모Honour and pleasure he finds, when to his garden he looks.-----AH, my maiden is going! she mounts the vessel! My monarch,

모모AEolus! potentate dread! keep ev'ry storm far away!"Oh, thou fool!" cried the god:"ne'er fear the blustering tempest;

모모When Love flutters his wings, then mayst thou dread the soft breeze."-----

모모ELEGIES.

모모-----PART I.

모모ROMAN ELEGIES.

모모[The Roman Elegies were written in the same year as the VenetianEpigrams--viz. 1790.]

모모SPEAK, ye stones, I entreat! Oh speak, ye palaces lofty!

모모Utter a word, oh ye streets! Wilt thou not, Genius, awake?All that thy sacred walls, eternal Rome, hold within them

모모Teemeth with life; but to me, all is still silent and dead.Oh, who will whisper unto me,--when shall I see at the casement

모모That one beauteous form, which, while it scorcheth, revives?Can I as yet not discern the road, on which I for ever

모모To her and from her shall go, heeding not time as it flies?Still do I mark the churches, palaces, ruins, and columns,

모모As a wise traveller should, would he his journey improve.Soon all this will be past; and then will there be but one temple,

모모Amor's temple alone, where the Initiate may go.Thou art indeed a world, oh Rome; and yet, were Love absent,

모모Then would the world be no world, then would e'en Rome be no Rome.-----Do not repent, mine own love, that thou so soon didst surrender

모모Trust me, I deem thee not bold! reverence only I feel.Manifold workings the darts of Amor possess; some but scratching,

모모Yet with insidious effect, poison the bosom for years.Others mightily feather'd, with fresh and newly-born sharpness

모모Pierce to the innermost bone, kindle the blood into flame.In the heroical times, when loved each god and each goddess,

모모Longing attended on sight; then with fruition was bless'd.Think'st thou the goddess had long been thinking of love and its pleasures

모모When she, in Ida's retreats, own'd to Anchises her flame?Had but Luna delayd to kiss the beautiful sleeper,

모모Oh, by Aurora, ere long, he had in envy been rous'd!Hero Leander espied at the noisy feast, and the lover

모모Hotly and nimbly, ere long, plunged in the night-cover'd flood.Rhea Silvia, virgin princess, roam'd near the Tiber,

모모Seeking there water to draw, when by the god she was seiz'd.Thus were the sons of Mars begotten! The twins did a she-wolf

모모Suckle and nurture,--and Rome call'd herself queen of the world,-----ALEXANDER, and Caesar, and Henry, and Fred'rick, the mighty,

모모On me would gladly bestow half of the glory they earn'd,Could I but grant unto each one night on the couch where I'm lying;

모모But they, by Orcus's night, sternly, alas! are held down.Therefore rejoice, oh thou living one, blest in thy love-lighted homestead,

모모Ere the dark Lethe's sad wave wetteth thy fugitive foot.-----THESE few leaves, oh ye Graces, a bard presents, in your honour,

모모On your altar so pure, adding sweet rosebuds as well,And he does it with hope. The artist is glad in his workshop,

모모When a Pantheon it seems round him for ever to bring.Jupiter knits his godlike brow,--her's, Juno up-lifteth;

모모Phoebus strides on before, shaking his curly-lock'd headCalmly and drily Minerva looks down, and Hermes the light one,

모모Turneth his glances aside, roguish and tender at once.But tow'rds Bacchus, the yielding, the dreaming, raiseth Cythere

모모Looks both longing and sweet, e'en in the marble yet moist.Of his embraces she thinks with delight, and seems to be asking

모모"Should not our glorious son take up his place by our side?"-----AMOR is ever a rogue, and all who believe him are cheated!

모모To me the hypocrite came: "Trust me, I pray thee, this once.Honest is now my intent,--with grateful thanks I acknowledge

모모That thou thy life and thy works hast to my worship ordain'd.See, I have follow'd thee thither, to Rome, with kindly intention,

모모Hoping to give thee mine aid, e'en in the foreigner's land.Every trav'ller complains that the quarters he meets with are wretched

모모Happily lodged, though, is he, who is by Amor receiv'd.Thou dost observe the ruins of ancient buildings with wonder,

모모Thoughtfully wandering on, over each time-hallow'd spot.Thou dost honour still more the worthy relics created

모모By the few artists--whom I loved in their studios to seek.I 'twas fashion'd those forms! thy pardon,--I boast not at present;

모모Presently thou shalt confess, that what I tell thee is true.Now that thou serv'st me more idly, where are the beauteous figures,

모모Where are the colours, the light, which thy creations once fill'd?Hast thou a mind again to form? The school of the Grecians

모모Still remains open, my friend; years have not barr'd up its doors.I, the teacher, am ever young, and love all the youthful,

모모Love not the subtle and old; Mother, observe what I say!Still was new the Antique, when yonder blest ones were living;

모모Happily live,--and, in thee, ages long vanish'd will live!Food for song, where hop'st thou to find it? I only can give it,

모모And a more excellent style, love, and love only can teach."Thus did the Sophist discourse. What mortal, alas! could resist him?

모모And when a master commands, I have been train'd to obey.Now he deceitfully keeps his word, gives food for my numbers,

모모But, while he does so, alas! robs me of time, strength, and mind.Looks, and pressure of hands, and words of kindness, and kisses,

모모Syllables teeming with thought, by a fond pair are exchang'd.Then becomes whispering, talk,--and stamm'ring, a language enchanting;

모모Free from all prosody's rules, dies such a hymn on the ear.Thee, Aurora, I used to own as the friend of the Muses;

모모Hath, then, Amor the rogue cheated, Aurora, e'en thee?Thou dost appear to me now as his friend, and again dost awake me

모모Unto a day of delight, while at his altar I kneel.All her locks I find on my bosom, her head is reposing,

모모Pressing with softness the arm, which round her neck is entwin'd;Oh! what a joyous awak'ning, ye hours so peaceful, succeeded,

모모Monument sweet of the bliss which had first rock'd us to sleepIn her slumber she moves, and sinks, while her face is averted,

모모Far on the breadth of the couch, leaving her hand still in mineHeartfelt love unites us for ever, and yearnings unsullied,

모모And our cravings alone claim for themselves the exchange.One faint touch of the hand, and her eyes so heavenly see I

모모Once more open. Ah, no! let me still look on that form!Closed still remain! Ye make me confused and drunken, ye rob me

모모Far too soon of the bliss pure contemplation affords.Mighty, indeed, are these figures! these limbs, how gracefully rounded!

모모Theseus, could'st thou e'er fly, whilst Ariadne thus slept?Only one single kiss on these lips! Oh, Theseus, now leave us!

모모Gaze on her eyes! she awakes--Firmly she holds thee embrac'd-----PART II.

모모Hastens, as onward it glides, cleaving the foam-cover'd flood!Long is the track plough'd up by the keel where dolphins are sporting,

모모Following fast in its rear, while it seems flying pursuit.All forebodes a prosperous voyage; the sailor with calmness

모모Leans 'gainst the sail, which alone all that is needed performs.Forward presses the heart of each seamen, like colours and streamers;

모모Backward one only is seen, mournfully fix'd near the mast,While on the blue tinged mountains, which fast are receding, he gazeth,

모모And as they sink in the sea, joy from his bosom departs.Vanish'd from thee, too, oh Dora, is now the vessel that robs thee

모모Of thine Alexis, thy friend,--ah, thy betrothed as well!Thou, too, art after me gazing in vain. Our hearts are still throbbing,

모모Though, for each other, yet ah! 'gainst one another no more.Oh, thou single moment, wherein I found life! thou outweighest

모모Every day which had else coldly from memory fled.'Twas in that moment alone, the last, that upon me descended

모모Life, such as deities grant, though thou perceived'st it not.Phoebus, in vain with thy rays dost thou clothe the ether in glory:

모모Thine all-brightening day hateful alone is to me.Into myself I retreat for shelter, and there, in the silence,

모모Strive to recover the time when she appear'd with each day.Was it possible beauty like this to see, and not feel it?

모모Work'd not those heavenly charms e'en on a mind dull as thine?Blame not thyself, unhappy one! Oft doth the bard an enigma

모모Thus propose to the throng, skillfully hidden in words.Each one enjoys the strange commingling of images graceful,

모모Yet still is wanting the word which will discover the sense.When at length it is found, the heart of each hearer is gladden'd,

모모And in the poem he sees meaning of twofold delight.Wherefore so late didst thou remove the bandage, oh Amor,

모모Which thou hadst placed o'er mine eyes,--wherefore remove it so late?Long did the vessel, when laden, lie waiting for favouring breezes,

모모'Till in kindness the wind blew from the land o'er the sea.Vacant times of youth! and vacant dreams of the future!

모모Ye all vanish, and nought, saving the moment, remains.Yes! it remains,--my joy still remains! I hold thee; my Dora,

모모And thine image alone, Dora, by hope is disclos'd.Oft have I seen thee go, with modesty clad, to the temple,

모모While thy mother so dear solemnly went by thy side.Eager  and nimble thou wert, in bearing thy fruit to the market,

모모Boldly the pail from the well didst thou sustain on thy head.Then was reveal'd thy neck, then seen thy shoulders so beauteous,

모모Then, before all things, the grace filling thy motions was seen.Oft have I fear'd that the pitcher perchance was in danger of falling,

모모Yet it ever remain'd firm on the circular cloth.Thus, fair neighbour, yes, thus I oft was wont to observe thee,

모모As on the stars I might gaze, as I might gaze on the moon,Glad indeed at the sight, yet feeling within my calm bosom

모모Not the remotest desire ever to call them mine own.Years thus fleeted away! Although our houses were only

모모Twenty paces apart, yet I thy threshold ne'er cross'd.Now by the fearful flood are we parted! Thou liest to Heaven,

모모Billow! thy beautiful blue seems to me dark as the night.All were now in movement; a boy to the house of my father

모모Ran at full speed and exclaim'd: "Hasten thee quick to the strandHoisted the sail is already, e'en now in the wind it is flutt'ring,

모모While the anchor they weigh, heaving it up from the sand;Come, Alexis, oh come!"--My worthy stout-hearted father

모모Press'd, with a blessing, his hand down on my curly-lock'd head,While my mother carefully reach'd me a newly-made bundle,

모모"Happy mayst thou return!" cried they--" both happy and rich!"Then I sprang away, and under my arm held the bundle,

모모Running along by the wall. Standing I found thee hard by,At the door of thy garden. Thou smilingly saidst then "Alexis!

모모Say, are yon boisterous crew going thy comrades to be?Foreign coasts will thou visit, and precious merchandise purchase,

모모Ornaments meet for the rich matrons who dwell in the town.Bring me, also, I praythee, a light chain; gladly I'll pay thee,

모모Oft have I wish'd to possess some stich a trinket as that."There I remain'd, and ask'd, as merchants are wont, with precision

모모After the form and the weight which thy commission should have.Modest, indeed, was the price thou didst name! I meanwhile was gazing

모모On thy neck which deserv'd ornaments worn but by queens.Loudly now rose the cry from the ship; then kindly thou spakest

모모"Take, I entreat thee, some fruit out of the garden, my friendTake the ripest oranges, figs of the whitest; the ocean

모모Beareth no fruit, and, in truth, 'tis not produced by each land."So I entered in. Thou pluckedst the fruit from the branches,

모모And the burden of gold was in thine apron upheld.Oft did I cry, Enough! But fairer fruits were still falling

모모Into the hand as I spake, ever obeying thy touch.Presently didst thou reached the arbour; there lay there a basket,

모모Sweet blooming myrtle trees wav'd, as we drew nigh, o'er our heads.Then thou began'st to arrange the fruit with skill and in silence:

모모First the orange, which lay heavy as though 'twere of gold,Then the yielding fig, by the slightest pressure disfigur'd,

모모And with myrtle the gift soon was both cover'd and grac'd.But I raised it not up. I stood. Our eyes met together,

모모And my eyesight grew dim, seeming obscured by a film,Soon I felt thy bosom on mine! Mine arm was soon twining

모모Round thy beautiful form; thousand times kiss'd I thy neck.On my shoulder sank thy head; thy fair arms, encircling,

모모Soon rendered perfect the ring knitting the rapturous pair.Amor's hands I felt: he press'd us together with ardour,

모모And, from the firmament clear, thrice did it thunder; then tearsStream'd from mine eyes in torrents, thou weptest, I wept, both were weeping,

모모And, 'mid our sorrow and bliss, even the world seem'd to die.Louder and louder they calI'd from the strand; my feet would no longer

모모Bear my weight, and I cried:--"Dora! and art thou not mine?""Thine forever!" thou gently didst say. Then the tears we were shedding

모모Seem'd to be wiped from our eyes, as by the breath of a god.Nearer was heard the cry "Alexis!" The stripling who sought me

모모Suddenly peep'd through the door. How he the basket snatch'd up!How he urged me away! how press'd I thy hand! Wouldst thou ask me

모모How the vessel I reach'd? Drunken I seem'd, well I know.Drunken my shipmates believed me, and so had pity upon me;

모모And as the breeze drove us on, distance the town soon obscur'd."Thine for ever!" thou, Dora, didst murmur; it fell on my senses

모모With the thunder of Zeus! while by the thunderer's throneStood his daughter, the Goddess of Love; the Graces were standing

모모Close by her side! so the bond beareth an impress divine!Oh then hasten, thou ship, with every favouring zephyr!

모모Onward, thou powerful keel, cleaving the waves as they foam!Bring me unto the foreign harbour, so that the goldsmith

모모May in his workshop prepare straightway the heavenly pledge!Ay, of a truth, the chain shall indeed be a chain, oh my Dora!

모모Nine times encircling thy neck, loosely around it entwin'dOther and manifold trinkets I'll buy thee; gold-mounted bracelets,

모모Richly and skillfully wrought, also shall grace thy fair hand.There shall the ruby and emerald vie, the sapphire so lovely

모모Be to the jacinth oppos'd, seeming its foil; while the goldHolds all the jewels together, in beauteous union commingled.

모모Oh, how the bridegroom exults, when he adorns his betroth'd!Pearls if I see, of thee they remind me; each ring that is shown me

모모Brings to my mind thy fair hand's graceful and tapering form.I will barter and buy; the fairest of all shalt thou choose thee,

모모Joyously would I devote all of the cargo to thee.Yet not trinkets and jewels alone is thy loved one procuring;

모모With them he brings thee whate'er gives to a housewife delight.Fine and woollen coverlets, wrought with an edging of purple,

모모Fit for a couch where we both, lovingly, gently may rest;Costly pieces of linen. Thou sittest and sewest, and clothest

모모Me, and thyself, and, perchance, even a third with it too.Visions of hope, deceive ye my heart! Ye kindly Immortals,

모모Soften this fierce-raging flame, wildly pervading my breast!Yet how I long to feel them again, those rapturous torments.

모모When, in their stead, care draws nigh, coldly and fearfully calm.Neither the Furies' torch, nor the hounds of hell with their harking

모모Awe the delinquent so much, down in the plains of despair,As by the motionless spectre I'm awed, that shows me the fair one

모모Far away: of a truth, open the garden-door stands!And another one cometh! For him the fruit, too, is falling,

모모And for him, also, the fig strengthening honey doth yield!Doth she entice him as well to the arbour? He follows? Oh, make me

모모Blind, ye Immortals! efface visions like this from my mind!Yes, she is but a maiden! And she who to one doth so quickly

모모Yield, to another ere long, doubtless, Will turn herself round.Smile not, Zeus, for this once, at an oath so cruelly broken!

모모Thunder more fearfully! Strike!--Stay--thy fierce lightnings withhold!Hurl at me thy quivering bolt! In the darkness of midnight

모모Strike with thy lightning this mast, make it a pitiful wreck!Scatter the planks all around, and give to the boisterous billows

모모All these wares, and let me be to the dolphins a preyNow, ye Muses, enough! In vain would ye strive to depicture

모모How, in a love-laden breast, anguish alternates with bliss.Ye cannot heal the wounds, it is true, that love hath inflicted;

모모Yet from you only proceeds, kindly ones, comfort and balm.

모모IN NINE CANTOS.-----I. KALLIOPE.

모모FATE AND SYMPATHY.

모모"NE'ER have I seen the market and streets so thoroughly empty!Still as the grave is the town, clear'd out! I verily fancyFifty at most of all our inhabitants still may be found there.People are so inquisitive! All are running and racingMerely to see the sad train of poor fellows driven to exile.Down to the causeway now building, the distance nearly a league is,And they thitherward rush, in the heat and the dust of the noonday.As for me, I had rather not stir from my place just to stare atWorthy and sorrowful fugitives, who, with what goods they can carry,Leaving their own fair land on the further side of the Rhine-stream,Over to us are crossing, and wander through the delightfulNooks of this fruitful vale, with all its twistings and windings.Wife, you did right well to bid our son go and meet them,Taking with him old linen, and something to eat and to drink too,Just to give to the poor; the rich are bound to befriend them.How he is driving along! How well he holds in the horses!Then the new little carriage looks very handsome; inside itFour can easily sit, besides the one on the coachbox.This time he is alone; how easily-turns it the corner!"Thus to his wife the host of the Golden Lion discoursed,Sitting at ease in the porch of his house adjoining the market.Then replied as follows the shrewd and sensible hostess"Father, I don't like giving old linen away, for I find itUseful in so many ways, 'tis not to he purchased for moneyJust when it's wanted. And yet to-day I gladly have givenMany excellent articles, shirts and covers and suchlike;For I have heard of old people and children walking half-naked.Will you forgive me, too, for having ransacked your presses?That grand dressing-gown, cover'd with Indian flowers all over,Made of the finest calico, lined with excellent flannel,I have despatch'd with the rest; 'tis thin, old, quite out of fashion."

모모But the worthy landlord only smiled, and then answer'dI shall dreadfully miss that ancient calico garment,Genuine Indian stuff! They're not to be had any longer.Well! I shall wear it no more. And your poor husband henceforwardAlways must wear a surtout, I suppose, or commonplace jacket,Always must put on his boots; good bye to cap and to slippers!"

모모"See," continued his wife, "a few are already returningWho have seen the procession, which long ago must have pass'd by.See how dusty their shoes are, and how their faces are glowingEach one carries a handkerchief, wiping the sweat from his forehead.I, for one, wouldn't hurry and worry myself in such weatherMerely to see such a sight! I'm certain to hear all about it."

모모And the worthy father, speaking with emphasis, added"Such fine weather seldom lasts through the whole of the harvestAnd we're bringing the fruit home, just as the hay we brought lately,Perfectly dry; the sky is clear, no cloud's in the heavens,And the whole day long delicious breezes are blowing.Splendid weather I call it! The corn already too ripe is,And to-morrow begin we to gather the plentiful harvest."

모모Whilst he was thus discoursing, the number of men and of womenCrossing the market and going towards home kept ever increasing;And there return'd amongst others, bringing with him his daughters,On the other side of the market, their prosperous neighbour,Going full speed to his newbuilt house, the principal merchant,Riding inside an open carriage (in Landau constructed).All the streets were alive; for the town, though small, was well peopled,Many a factory throve there, and many a business also.

모모Long sat the excellent couple under the doorway, exchangingMany a passing remark on the people who happen'd to pass them.Presently thus to her husband exclaim'd the good-natured hostess"See! Yon comes the minister; with him is walking the druggist:They'll be able to give an account of all that has happen'd,What they witness'd, and many a sight I fear which was painful."

모모Both of them came in a friendly manner, and greeted the couple,Taking their seats on the wooden benches under the doorway,Shaking the dust from their feet, their handkerchiefs using to fan them.Presently, after exchanging reciprocal greetings, the druggistOpen'd his mouth, and almost peevishly vented his feelings"What strange creatures men are! They all resemble each other,All take pleasure in staring, when troubles fall on their neighbours.Ev'ry one runs to see the flames destroying a dwelling,Or a poor criminal led in terror and shame to the scaffold.All the town has been out to gaze at the sorrowing exiles,None of them bearing in mind that a like misfortune hereafter,Possibly almost directly, may happen to be their own portion.I can't pardon such levity; yet 'tis the nature of all men."Thereupon rejoin'd the noble and excellent pastor,He, the charm of the town, in age scarce more than a stripling:--(He was acquainted with life, and knew the wants of his hearers,Fully convinced of the worth of the Holy Scriptures, whose missionIs to reveal man's fate, his inclinations to fathom;He was also well read in the best of secular writings.)"I don't like to find fault with any innocent impulseWhich in the mind of man Dame Nature has ever implanted;For what reason and intellect ne'er could accomplish, is oftenDone by some fortunate, quite irresistible instinct within him.If mankind were never by curiosity driven,Say, could they e'er have found out for themselves the wonderful mannerThings in the world range in order? For first they Novelty look for,Then with untiring industry seek to discover the Useful,Lastly they yearn for the Good, which makes them noble and worthy.All through their youth frivolity serves as their joyous companion,Hiding the presence of danger, and. swiftly effacing the tracesCaused by misfortune and grief, as soon as their onslaught is over.Truly the man's to be praised who, as years roll onward, developsOut of such glad disposition an intellect settled and steady,--Who, in good fortune as well as misfortune, strives zealously, nobly;For what is Good he brings forth, replacing whatever is injured."Then in a friendly voice impatiently spoke thus the hostess:--"Tell us what have you seen; I am eagerly longing to hear it."

모모Then with emphasis answer'd the druggist:--" The terrible storiesTold me to-day will serve for a long time to make me unhappy.Words would fail to describe the manifold pictures of mis'ry.Far in the distance saw we the dust, before we descendedDown to the meadows; the rising hillocks hid the processionLong from our eyes, and little could we distinguish about it.When, however, we reach'd the road that winds thro' the valley,Great was the crowd and the noise of the emigrants mix'd with the waggons.We unhappily saw poor fellows passing in numbers,Some of them showing how bitter the sense of their sorrowful flight was,Some with a feeling of joy at saving their lives in a hurry.Sad was the sight of the manifold goods and chattels pertainingUnto a well-managed house, which the careful owner's accustom'dEach in its proper position to place, and in regular order,Always ready for use, for all are wanted and useful.--Sad was the sight of them now, on many a waggon and barrowHeap'd in thorough confusion, and hurriedly huddled together.Over a cupboard was placed a sieve and a coverlet woollen;Beds in the kneeding troughs lay, and linen over the glasses.Ah! and the danger appear'd to rob the men of their senses,Just as in our great fire of twenty years ago happen'd,When what was worthless they saved, and left all the best things behind them.So on the present occasion with heedless caution they carriedMany valueless chattels, o'erlading the cattle and horses,--Common old boards and barrels, a birdcage next to a goosepen.Women and children were gasping beneath the weight of their bundles,Baskets and tubs full of utterly useless articles, bearing.(Man is always unwilling the least of his goods to abandon.)Thus on its dusty way advanced the crowded procession,All in hopeless confusion. First one, whose cattle were weaker,Fain would slowly advance, while others would eagerly hasten.Then there arose a scream of half-crush'd women and children,And a lowing of cattle, with yelping of dogs intermingled,And a wailing of aged and sick, all sitting and shaking,Ranged in their beds on the top of the waggon too-heavily laden.Next some lumbering wheel, push'd out of the track by the pressure,Went to the edge of the roadway; the vehicle fell in the ditch then,Rolling right over, and throwing, in falling, the men who were in itFar in the field, screaming loudly, their persons however uninjured.Then the boxes roll'd off and tumbled close to the waggon.Those who saw them failing full surely expected to see themSmash'd to pieces beneath the weight of the chests and the presses.So the waggon lay broken, and those that it carried were helpless,For the rest of the train went on, and hurriedly pass'd them,Thinking only of self, and carried away by the current.So we sped to the spot, and found the sick and the agedWho, when at home and in bed, could scarcely endure their sad ailments,Lying there on the ground, all sighing and groaning in anguish,Stifled by clouds of dust, and scorch'd by the fierce sun of summer.

모모Then replied in tones of compassion the sensitive landlordHermann I trust will find them and give them refreshment and clothing.I should unwillingly see them: I grieve at the eight of such sorrow.Touch'd by the earliest news of the sad extent of the suffering,Hastily sent we a trifle from out of our superabundance,Just to comfort a few, and then our minds were more easy.Now let us cease to discourse on such a sorrowful subject,For men's hearts are easily overshadow'd by terror,And by care, more odious far to me than misfortune.Now let us go to a cooler place, the little back-parlour;There the sun never shines, and the walls are so thick that the hot airNever can enter; and mother shall forthwith bring us a glass eachFull of fine Eighty-three, well fitted to drive away trouble.This is a bad place for drinking; the flies will hum round the glasses."So they all went inside, enjoying themselves in the coolness.Then in a well-cut flask the mother carefully brought themSome of that clear good wine, upon a bright metal waiterWith those greenish rummers, the fittingest goblets for Rhine wine.So the three sat together, around the glistening polish'dCircular large brown table-캂n massive feet it was planted.Merrily clink'd together the glasses of host and of pastor,But the other one thoughtfully held his glass without moving,And in friendly fashion the host thus ask'd him to join them:--

모모"Drink, good neighbour, I pray! A merciful God has protectedUs in the past from misfortune, and will protect us in future.All must confess that since He thought fit to severely chastise us,When that terrible fire occurr'd, He has constantly bless'd us.And watch'd over us constantly, just as man is accustom'dHis eye's precious apple to guard, that dearest of members.Shall He not for the future preserve us, and be our Protector?For 'tis in danger we learn to appreciate duly His Goodness.This so flourishing town, which He built again from its ashesBy the industrious hands of its burghers, and bless'd it so richly,Will He again destroy it, and render their toil unavailing?"

모모Cheerfully answer'd the excellent pastor, in accents of mildness"Steadfastly cling to this faith, and cherish such worthy opinions;In good fortune they'll make you prudent, and then in misfortuneWell-grounded hopes they'll supply, and furnish you true consolation."

모모Then continued the host, with thoughts full of manhood and wisdom"Oft have I greeted with wonder the rolling flood of the Rhine stream,When, on my business trav'lling, I've once more come to its borders.Grand has it ever appear'd, exalting my feelings and senses;But I could never imagine that soon its beautiful marginInto a wall would be turn'd, to keep the French from our country,And its wide-spreading bed a ditch to hinder and check them.So by Nature we're guarded, we're guarded by valorous Germans,And by the Lord we're guarded; who then would foolishly tremble?Weary the combatants are, and all things indicate peace soon;And when at length the long-expected festival's holdenHere in our church, and the bells chime in with the organ in chorus,And the trumpets are blowing, the noble Te Deum upraising,Then on that selfsame day I fain would see, my good pastor,Our dear Hermann kneel with his bride at the altar before you,And the glad festival held through the length and breadth of the countryWill henceforward to me be a glad anniversary also!But I am grieved to observe that the youth, who is always so activeWhen he is here at home, abroad is so slow and so timid.Little at any time cares he to mix with the rest of the people;Yes, he even avoids young maidens' society ever,And the frolicsome dance, that great delight of young people."

모모Thus he spake, and then listen'd. The sound of the stamping of horsesDrawing nearer was heard; and then the roll of the carriage,Which, with impetuous speed, now thunder'd under the gateway.-----II.  TERPSICHORE.

모모HERMANN.

모모THEN when into the room the well-built son made his entry,Straightway with piercing glances the minister eyed him intently,And with carefulness watch'd his looks and the whole of his bearing,With an inquiring eye which easily faces decyphers;Then he smiled, and with cordial words address'd him as follows"How you are changed in appearance, my friend! I never have seen youHalf so lively before; your looks are thoroughly cheerful.You have return'd quite joyous and merry. You've doubtless dividedAll of the presents amongst the poor, their blessings receiving."

모모Then in calm accents replied the son, with gravity speaking"Whether I've laudably acted, I know not; I follow'd the impulseOf my own heart, as now I'll proceed to describe with exactness.Mother, you rummaged so long, in looking over old pieces,And in making your choice, that 'twas late when the bundle was ready,And the wine and the beer were slowly and carefully pack'd up.When I at length emerged at the gate, and came on the highway,Streams of citizens met I returning, with women and children,For the train of the exiles had long disappear'd in the distance.So I quicken'd my pace, and hastily drove to the villageWhere I had heard that to-night to rest and to sleep they intended.Well, as I went on my way, the newly-made causeway ascending,Suddenly saw I a waggon, of excellent timber constructed,Drawn by a couple of oxen, the best and the strongest of foreign.Close beside it there walk'd, with sturdy footsteps, a maiden,Guiding the two strong beasts with a long kind of staff, which with skill sheKnew how to use, now driving, and now restraining their progress.When the maiden observed me, she quietly came near the horses,And address'd me as follows:--'Our usual condition, believe me,Is not so sad as perchance you might judge from our present appearance.I am not yet accustom'd to ask for alms from a stranger,Who so often but gives, to rid himself of a beggar.But I'm compell'd to speak by necessity. Here on the straw nowLies the lately-confined poor wife of a wealthy landowner,Whom with much trouble I managed to save with oxen and waggon.We were late in arriving, and scarcely with life she escaped.Now the newly-born child in her arms is lying, all naked,And our friends will be able to give them but little assistance,E'en if in the next village, to which to-night we are going,We should still find them, although I fear they have left it already.If you belong to the neighbourhood, any available linenThese poor people will deem a most acceptable present.

모모"Thus she spake, and wearily raised herself the pale patientUp from the straw and gazed upon me, while thus I made answer'Oft doth a heavenly spirit whisper to kind-hearted people,So that they feel the distress o'er their poorer brethren impending;For my mother, your troubles foreboding, gave me a bundleReady prepared for relieving the wants of those who were naked.'Then I loosen'd the knots of the cord, and the dressing-gown gave herWhich belong'd to my father, and gave her some shirts and some linen,And she thank'd me with joy and said:--'The fortunate know notHow 'tis that miracles happen; we only discover in sorrowGod's protecting finger and hand, extended to beckonGood men to good. May your kindness to us by Him be requited.'And I saw the poor patient joyfully handling the linen,Valuing most of all the soft flannel, the dressing-gown lining.Then the maid thus address'd her:--'Now let us haste to the villageWhere our friends are resting, to-night intending to sleep thereThere I will straightway attend to what e'er for the infant is needed.'Then she saluted me too, her thanks most heartily giving,Drove the oxen, the waggon went on. I lingerd behind them,Holding my horses rein'd back, divided between two opinions,Whether to hasten ahead, reach the village, the viands distribute'Mongst the rest of the people, or give them forthwith to the maiden,So that she might herself divide them amongst them with prudenceSoon I made up my mind, and follow'd after her softly,Overtook her without delay, and said to her quickly'Maiden, it was not linen alone that my mother providedAnd in the carriage placed, as clothing to give to the naked,But she added meat, and many an excellent drink too;And I have got quite a stock stow'd away in the boot of the carriage.Well, I have taken a fancy the rest of the gifts to depositIn your hands, and thus fulfil to the best my commission;You will divide them with prudence, whilst I my fate am obeying.'Then the maiden replied:--'With faithfulness I will distributeAll your gifts, and the needy shall surely rejoice at your bounty.'Thus she spake, and I hastily open'd the boot of the carriage,Took out the hams (full heavy they were) and took out the bread-stuffs,Flasks of wine and beer, and handed the whole of them over.Gladly would I have given her more, but empty the boot was.Straightway she pack'd them away at the feet of the patient, and forthwithStarted again, whilst I hasten'd back to the town with my horses."

모모Then when Hermann had ended his story, the garrulous neighbourOpen'd his mouth and exclaim'd:--"I only deem the man happyWho lives alone in his house in these days of flight and confusion,Who has neither wife nor children cringing beside himI feel happy at present; I hate the title of father;Care of children and wife in these days would be a sad drawback.Often have I bethought me of flight, and have gather'd togetherAll that I deem most precious, the antique gold and the jewelsWorn by my late dear mother, not one of which has been sold yet.Much indeed is left out, that is not so easily carried.Even the herbs and the roots, collected with plenty of trouble,I should he sorry to lose, though little in value they may be.If the dispenser remains, I shall leave my house in good spiritsIf my ready money is saved, and my body, why trulyAll is saved, for a bachelor easily flies when 'tis needed."

모모"Neighbour," rejoin'd forthwith young Hermann, with emphasis speaking"Altogether I differ, and greatly blame your opinions.Can that man be deem'd worthy, who both in good and ill fortuneThinks alone of himself, and knows not the secret of sharingSorrows and joys with others, and feels no longing to do so?I could more easily now than before determine to marryMany an excellent maiden needs a husband's protection,Many a man a cheerful wife, when sorrow's before him."Smilingly said then the father:--"I'm pleas'd to hear what you're saying,Words of such wisdom have seldom been utter'd by you in my presence.

모모Then his good mother broke in, in her turn, with vivacity speaking"Son, you are certainly right. We parents set the example.'Twas not in time of pleasure that we made choice of each other,And 'twas the saddest of hours, that knitted us closely together.Monday morning,--how well I remember! the very day afterThat most terrible fire occurr'd which burnt down the borough,Twenty years ago now; the day, like to-day, was a Sunday,Hot and dry was the weather, and little available water.All the inhabitants, clothed in their festival garments, were walking,Scatter'd about in the inns and the mills of the neighbouring hamlets.At one end of the town the fire broke out, and the flames ranHastily all through the streets, impell'd by the draught they created.And the barns were consumed, where all the rich harvest was gather'dAnd all the streets as far as the market; the dwelling house alsoOf my father hard by was destroy'd, as likewise was this one.Little indeed could we save; I sat the sorrowful night throughOn the green of the town, protecting the beds and the boxes.Finally sleep overtook me, and when by the cool breeze of morningWhich dies away when the sun arises I was awaken'd,Saw I the smoke and the glow, and the half-consumed walls and the chimneys.Then my heart was sorely afflicted; but soon in his gloryRose the sun more brilliant than ever, my spirits reviving.Then in haste I arose, impell'd the site to revisitWhere our dwelling had stood, to see if the chickens were livingWhich I especially loved; for childlike I still was by nature.But when over the ruins of courtyard and house I was climbing,Which still smoked, and saw my dwelling destroy'd and deserted,You came up on the other side, the ruins exploring.You had a horse shut up in his stall; the still-glowing raftersOver it lay, and rubbish, and nought could be seen of the creature.Over against each other we stood, in doubt and in sorrow,For the wall had fallen which used to sever our courtyards;And you grasp'd my hand, addressing me softly as follows'Lizzy, what here are you doing? Away! Your soles you are burning,For the rubbish is hot, and is scorching my boots which are thicker.'Then you lifted me up, and carried me off through your courtyard.There still stood the gateway before the house, with its arch'd roof,Just as it now is standing, the only thing left remaining.And you sat me down and kiss'd me, and I tried to stop you,But you presently said, with kindly words full of meaning'See, my house is destroy'd! Stop here and help me to build it,I in return will help to rebuild the house of your father.'I understood you not, till you sent to my father your mother,And ere long our marriage fulfilid the troth we soon plighted.Still to this day I remember with pleasure the half-consumed rafters,Still do I see the sun in all his majesty rising,For on that day I gain'd my husband; the son of my youth tooGained I during that earliest time of the wild desolation.Therefore commend I you, Hermann, for having with confidence guilelessTurn'd towards marriage your thoughts in such a period of mourning,And for daring to woo in war and over the ruins.--"

모모Then the father straightway replied, with eagerness speaking:--"Sensible is your opinion, and true is also the storyWhich you have told us, good mother, for so did ev'rything happen.But what is better is better. 'Tis not the fortune of all menAll their life and existence to find decided beforehand;All are not doom'd to such troubles as we and others have suffer'd.O, how happy is he whose careful father and motherHave a house ready to give him, which he can successfully manage!All beginnings are hard, and most so the landlords profession.Numberless things a man must have, and ev'rything dailyDearer becomes, so he needs to scrape together more money.So I am hoping that you, dear Hermann, will shortly be bringingHome to us a bride possessing an excellent dowry,For a worthy husband deserves a girl who is wealthy,And 'tis a capital thing for the wish'd-for wife to bring with herPlenty of suitable articles stow'd in her baskets and boxes.Not in vain for years does the mother prepare for her daughterStocks of all kinds of linen, both finest and strongest in texture;Not in vain do god-parents give them presents of silver,Or the father lay by in his desk a few pieces of money.For she hereafter will gladden, with all her goods and possessions,That happy youth who is destined from out of all others to choose her.Yes! I know how pleasant it makes a house for a young wife,When she finds her own property placed in the rooms and the kitchen,And when she herself has cover'd the bed and the table.Only well-to-do brides should be seen in a house, I consider,For a poor one is sure at last to be scorn'd by her husband,And he'll deem her a jade who as jade first appear'd with her bundle.Men are always unjust, but moments of love are but transient.Yes, my Hermann, you greatly would cheer the old age of your fatherIf you soon would bring home a daughter-in-law to console me,Out of the neighbourhood too,--yes, out of yon dwelling, the green one!Rich is the man, in truth his trade and his manufacturesMake him daily richer, for when does a merchant not prosper?He has only three daughters; the whole of his wealth they'll inherit.True the eldest's already engaged; but then there's the second,And the third, who still (not for long) may be had for the asking.Had I been in your place, I should not till this time have waited;Bring home one of the girls, as I brought your mother before you.

모모Then, with modesty, answer'd the son his impetuous father"Truly my wish was, like yours, to marry one of the daughtersOf our neighbour. We all, in fact, were brought up together,Sported in youthful days near the fountain adjoining the market,And from the rudeness of boys I often managed to save them.But those days have long pass'd the maidens grew up, and with reasonStop now at home and avoid the rougher pastimes of childhood.Well brought up with a vengeance they are! To please you, I sometimesWent to visit them, just for the sake of olden acquaintanceBut I was never much pleased at holding intercourse with them,For they were always finding fault, and I had to bear itFirst my coat was too long, the cloth too coarse, and the colourFar too common, my hair was cut and curl'd very badly.I at last was thinking of dressing myself like the shop-boys,Who are accustom'd on Sundays to show off their persons up yonder,And round whose coats in summer half-silken tatters are hanging.But ere long I discover'd they only intended to fool meThis was very annoying, my pride was offended, but more stillFelt I deeply wounded that they so mistook the good feelingsWhich I cherish'd towards them, especially Minnie, the youngest.Well, I went last Easter, politely to pay them a visit,And I wore the new coat now hanging up in the closet,And was frizzled and curld, like all the rest of the youngsters.When I enter'd, they titter'd; but that didn't very much matter.Minnie sat at the piano, the father was present amongst them,Pleased with his daughter's singing, and quite in a jocular humour.Little could I understand of the words in the song she was singing,But I constantly heard of Pamina, and then of Tamino,*

모모(* Characters In Mozart's Zauberflote.)And I fain would express my opinion; so when she had ended,I ask'd questions respecting the text, and who were the persons.All were silent and smiled; but presently answer'd the father'Did you e'er happen, my friend, to hear of Eve or of Adam?'Then no longer restrain'd they themselves, the girls burst out laughing,All the boys laugh'd loudly, the old man's sides appear'd splitting.In my confusion I let my hat fall down, and the titt'ringLasted all the time the singing and playing continued.Then I hasten'd home, ashamed and full of vexation,Hung up my coat in the closet, and put my hair in disorderWith my fingers, and swore ne'er again to cross o'er their threshold.And I'm sure I was right; for they are all vain and unloving.And I hear they're so rude as to give me the nickname Tamino."Then the mother rejoin'd:--"You're wrong, dear Hermann, to harbourAngry feelings against the children, for they are but children.Minnie's an excellent girl, and has a tenderness for you;Lately she ask'd how you were. Indeed, I wish you would choose her!"

모모Then the son thoughtfully answer'd:--"I know not why, but the fact isMy annoyance has graven itself in my mind, and hereafterI could not bear at the piano to see her, or list to her singing."

모모But the father sprang up, and said, in words full of anger"Little comfort you give me, in truth! I always have said it,When you took pleasure in horses, and cared for nothing but fieldwork;That which the servants of prosperous people perform as their duty,You yourself do; meanwhile the father his son must dispense with,Who in his honour was wont to court the rest of the townsfolk.Thus with empty hopes your mother early deceived me,When your reading, and writing, and learning at school ne'er succeededLike the rest of the boys, and so you were always the lowest.This all comes from a youth not possessing a due sense of honour,And not having the spirit to try and raise his position.Had my father but cared for me, as I have for you, sir,Sent me to school betimes, and given me proper instructors,I should not merely have been the host of the famed Golden Lion."

모모But the son arose, and approach'd the doorway in silence,Slowly, and making no noise: but then the father in dudgeonAfter him shouted:--"Be off! I know you're an obstinate fellow!Go and look after the business; else I shall scold you severely;But don't fancy I'll ever allow you to bring home in triumphAs my daughter-in-law any boorish impudent hussy.Long have I lived in the world, and know how to manage most people,Know how to entertain ladies and gentlemen, so that they leave meIn good humour, and know how to flatter a stranger discreetly.But my daughter-in-law must have useful qualities also,And be able to soften my manifold cares and vexations.She must also play on the piano, that all the best peopleHere in the town may take pleasure in often coming to see us,As in the house of our neighbour the merchant happens each Sunday."Softly the son at these words raised the latch, and left the apartment.-----III. THALIA.

모모THE BURGHERS.

모모THUS did the prudent son escape from the hot conversation,But the father continued precisely as he had begun itWhat is not in a man can never come out of him, surely!Never, I fear, shall I see fulfill'd my dearest of wishes,That my son should be unlike his father, but better.What would be the fate of a house or a town, if its inmatesDid not all take pride in preserving, renewing, improving,As we are taught by the age, and by the wisdom of strangers?Man is not born to spring out of the ground, just like a mere mushroom,And to rot away soon in the very place that produced him!Leaving behind him no trace of what he has done in his lifetime.One can judge by the look of a house of the taste of its master,As on ent'ring a town, one can judge the authorities' fitness.For where the towers and walls are falling, where in the ditchesDirt is collected, and dirt in every street is seen lying,Where the stones come out of their groove, and are not replaced there,Where the beams are rotting, and vainly the houses are waitingNew supports; that town is sure to be wretchedly managed.For where order and cleanliness reign not supreme in high places,Then to dirt and delay the citizens soon get accustom'd,Just as the beggar's accustom'd to wear his cloths full of tatters.Therefore I often have wish'd that Hermann would start on his travelsEre he's much older, and visit at any rate Strasburg and Frankfort,And that pleasant town, Mannheim, so evenly built and so cheerful.He who has seen such large and cleanly cities rests neverTill his own native town, however small, he sees better'd.Do not all strangers who visit us praise our well-mended gateways,And the well-whited tower, the church so neatly repair'd too?Do not all praise our pavements? Our well-arranged cover'd-in conduits,Always well furnish'd with water, utility blending with safety,So that a fire, whenever it happens, is straightway extinguish'd,--Is not this the result of that conflagration so dreadful?Six times in Council I superintended the town's works, receivingHearty thanks and assistance from every well-disposed burgher.How I design'd, follow'd up, and ensured the completion of measuresWorthy men had projected, and afterwards left all unfinish'd!Finally, every man in the Council took pleasure in working.All put forth their exertions, and now they have finally settledThat new highway to make, which will join our town with the main road.But I am greatly afraid that the young generation won't act thus;Some on the one hand think only of pleasure and trumpery dresses,Others wont stir out of doors, and pass all their time by the fireside,And our Hermann, I fear, will always be one of this last sort."

모모Forthwith to him replied the excellent sensible mother"Father, you're always unjust whenever you speak of your son, andThat is the least likely way to obtain your wishes' fulfillment,For we cannot fashion our children after our fancy.We must have them and love them, as God has given them to us,Bring them up for the best, and let each do as he listeth.One has one kind of gift, another possesses another,Each one employs them, and each in turn in his separate fashionGood and happy becomes. My Hermann shall not be upbraided,For I know that he well deserves the wealth he'll inherit;He'll be an excellent landlord, a pattern to burghers and peasants,And, as I clearly foresee, by no means the last in the Council.But with your blame and reproaches, you daily dishearten him sadly,As you have done just now, and make the poor fellow unhappy."

모모Then she left the apartment, and after her son hasten'd quickly,Hoping somewhere to find him, and with her words of affectionGladden his heart, for he, the excellent son, well deserved it.Smilingly, when she had closed the door, continued the father"What a wonderful race of people are women and children.All of them fain would do whatever pleases their fancy,And we're only alow'd to praise them and flatter them freely.Once for all there's truth in the ancient proverb which tells us:He who moves not forward, goes backward! a capital saying!"

모모Speaking with much circumspection, the druggist made answer as follows"What you say, good neighbour, is certainly true, and my plan isAlways to think of improvement, provided tho' new, 'tis not costly.But what avails it in truth, unless one has plenty of money,Active and fussy to he, improving both inside and outside?Sadly confined are the means of a burgher; e'en when he knows it,Little that's good he is able to do, his purse is too narrow,And the sum wanted too great; and so he is always prevented.I have had plenty of schemes! but then I was terribly frighten'dAt the expense, especially during a time of such danger.Long had my house smiled upon me, decked out in modish exterior,Long had my windows with large panes of glass resplendently glitterd.Who can compete with a merchant, however, who, rolling in riches,Also knows the manner in which what is best can be purchased?Only look at the house up yonder, the new one: how handsomeLooks the stucco of those white scrolls on the green-colour'd panels!Large are the plates of the windows--how shining and brilliant the panes are,Quite eclipsing the rest of the houses that stand in the market!Yet at the time of the fire, our two were by far the most handsome,Mine at the sign of the Angel, and yours at the old Golden Lion.Then my garden was famous throughout the whole country, and strangersUsed to stop as they pass'd and peep through my red-colourd palingsAt my beggars of stone, and at my dwarfs, which were painted,He to whom I gave coffee inside my beautiful grotto,Which, alas! is now cover'd with dust and tumbling to pieces,Used to rejoice in the colour'd glimmering light of the mussels,Ranged in natural order around it, and connoisseurs evenUsed with dazzled eyes to gaze at the spars and the coral.Then, in the drawing-room, people look'd with delight on the painting,Where the prim ladies and gentlemen walked in the garden demurely,And with pointed fingers presented the flowers, and held them.Ah, if only such things were now to be seen! Little care INow to go out; for everything needs to be alter'd and tasteful,As it is call'd; and white are the benches of wood and the palings;All things are simple and plain; and neither carving not gildingNow are employ'd, and foreign timber is now all the fashion.I should be only too pleased to possess some novelty also,So as to march with the times, and my household furniture alter.But we all are afraid to make the least alteration,For who is able to pay the present charges of workmen?Lately a fancy possess'd me, the angel Michael, whose figureHangs up over my shop, to treat to a new coat of gilding,And the terrible Dragon, who round his feet is entwining;But I have left him all brown; as he is; for the cost quite alarm'd me."-----IV. EUTERPE.

모모MOTHER AND SON.

모모THUS the men discoursed together; and meanwhile the motherWent in search of her son,--at first in front of the dwellingOn the bench of stone, for he was accustom'd to sit there.When she found him not there, she went to look in the stable,Thinking perchance he was feeding his splendid horses, the stallionsWhich he had bought when foals, and which he entrusted to no one.But the servant inform'd her that he had gone to the garden.Then she nimbly strode across the long double courtyard,Left the stables behind, and the barns all made of good timber,Enter'd the garden which stretch'd far away to the walls of the borough,Walk'd across it, rejoicing to see how all things were growing,Carefully straighten'd the props, on which the apple-tree's branches,Heavily loaded, reposed, and the weighty boughs of the pear-tree,Took a few caterpillars from off the strong-sprouting cabbage;For a bustling woman is never idle one moment.In this manner she came to the end of the long-reaching garden,Where was the arbour all cover'd with woodbine: she found not her son there,Nor was he to be seen in any part of the garden.But she found on the latch the door which out of the arbourThrough the wall of the town had been made by special permissionDuring their ancestor's time, the worthy old burgomaster.So she easily stepp'd across the dry ditch at the spot whereOn the highway abutted their well-inclosed excellent vineyard.Rising steeply upwards, its face tow'rd the sun turn'd directly.Up the hill she proceeded, rejoicing, as farther she mounted,At the size of the grapes, which scarcely were hid by the foliage.Shady and well-cover'd in, the middle walk at the top was,Which was ascended by steps of rough flat pieces constructed.And within it were hanging fine chasselas and muscatels also,And a reddish-blue grape, of quite an exceptional bigness,All with carefulness planted, to give to their guests after dinner.But with separate stems the rest of the vineyard was planted,Smaller grapes producing, from which the finest wine made is.So she constantly mounted, enjoying in prospect the autumn.And the festal day, when the neighbourhood met with rejoicing,Picking and treading the grapes, and putting the must in the wine-vats,Every corner and nook resounding at night with the fireworks,Blazing and cracking away, due honour to pay to the harvest.But she uneasy became, when she in vain had been callingTwice and three times her son, and when the sole answer that reach'd herCame from the garrulous echo which out of the town towers issued.Strange it appear'd to have to seek him; he never went far off,(As he before had told her) in order to ward off all sorrowFrom his dear mother, and her forebodings of coming disaster.But she still was expecting upon the highway to find him,For the doors at the bottom, like those at the top, of the vineyardStood wide open; and so at length she enter'd the broad fieldWhich, with its spreading expanse, o'er the whole of the hill's back extended.On their own property still she proceeded, greatly rejoicingAt their own crops, and at the corn which nodded so bravely,Over the whole field in golden majesty waving.Then on the border between the fields she follow'd the footpath,Keeping her eye on the pear-tree fix'd, the big one, which standingPerch'd by itself on the top of the hill, their property bounded.Who had planted it, no one knew; throughout the whole countryFar and wide was it visible; noted also its fruit was.Under its shadow the reaper ate his dinner at noonday,And the herdsman was wont to lie, when tending his cattle.Benches made of rough stones and of turf were placed all about it.And she was not mistaken; there sat her Hermann and restedOn his arm he was leaning, and seem'd to be looking cross countryTow'rds the mountains beyond; his back was turn'd to his mother.Softly creeping up, she lightly tapp'd on his shoulder;And he hastily turn'd; she saw that his eyes full of tears were.

모모"Mother," he said in confusion:--"You greatly surprise me!" and quicklyWiped he away his tears, the noble and sensitive youngster."What! You are weeping, my son?" the startled mother continued"That is indeed unlike you! I never before saw you crying!Say, what has sadden'd your heart? What drives you to sit here all lonelyUnder the shade of the pear-tree? What is it that makes you unhappy?"

모모Then the excellent youth collected himself, and made answer"Truly that man can have no heart, but a bosom of iron,Who no sympathy feels for the wants of unfortunate exiles;He has no sense in his head who, in times of such deep tribulation,Has no concern for himself or for his country's well-being.What I to-day have seen and heard, has stirr'd up my feelings;Well, I have come up here, and seen the beautiful, spreadingLandscape, which in fruitful hills to our sight is presented,Seen the golden fruit of the sheaves all nodding together,And a plentiful crop of fruit, full garners foreboding.But, alas, how near is the foe! By the Rhine's flowing watersWe are protected indeed; but what are rivers and mountainsTo such a terrible nation, which hurries along like a tempest!For they summon together the young and the old from all quarters,Rushing wildly along, while the multitude little is caringEven for death; when one falls, his place is straight fill'd by another,Ah! and can Germans dare to remain at home in their dwellings,Thinking perchance to escape from the widely-threat'ning disaster?Dearest mother, I tell you that I to-day am quite sorryThat I was lately excused, when they selected the fightersOut of the townfolk. 'Tis true I'm an only son, and more-overLarge is our inn, and our business also is very important;Were it not better however for me to fight in the vanguardOn the frontier, than here to await disaster and bondage?Yes, my spirit has told me, and in my innermost bosomFeel I courage and longing to live and die for my country,And to others to set an example worthy to follow.Oh, of a truth, if the strength of the German youths was collectedOn the frontier, all bound by a vow not to yield to the stranger,He on our noble soil should never set foot, or be ableUnder our eyes to consume the fruits of the land, or to issueOrders unto our men, or despoil our women and maidens!See, good mother, within my inmost heart I've determinedSoon and straightway to do what seems to me right and becoming;For the man who thinks long, not always chooses what best is.See, I will not return to the house, but will go from here straightwayInto the town, and there will place at the fighters' disposalThis stout arm and this heart, to serve, as I best can, my country.Then let my father say whether feelings of honour are stirringIn my bosom or not, and whether I yearn to mount upwards."

모모Then with significance answer'd his good and sensible mother,Shedding tears in silence, which easily rose in her eyelids:--"Son, what has wrought so strange a change in your temper and feelings,That you freely and openly speak to your mother no longer,As you till yesterday did, nor tell her truly your wishes?If another had heard you speaking, he doubtless would praise youHighly, and deem your new resolution as worthy of honour,Being deceived by your words, and by your manner of speaking.I however can only blame you. I know you much better.You are concealing your heart, and very diff'rent your thoughts are;For I am sure you care not at all for drum and for trumpet,Nor, to please the maidens, care you to wear regimentals.For, though brave you may be, and gallant, your proper vocationIs to remain at home, the property quietly watching.Therefore tell me truly: What means this sudden decision?"

모모Earnestly answer'd the son:--"You are wrong, dear-mother, one day isUnlike another. The youth soon ripens into his manhood.Ofttimes he ripens better to action in silence than livingThat tumultuous noisy life which ruins so many.And though silent I have been, and am, a heart has been fashion'dInside my bosom, which hates whatever unfair and unjust is,And I am able right well to discriminate secular matters.Work moreover my arms and my feet has mightily strengthen'd.All that I tell you is true; I boldly venture to say so.And yet, mother, you blame me with reason; you've caught me employingWords that are only half true, and that serve to conceal my true feelings.For I must need confess, it is not the advent of dangerCalls me away from my father's house, nor a resolute purposeUseful to be to my country, and dreaded to be by the foeman.Words alone it was that I utter'd,--words only intendedThose deep feelings to hide, which within my breast are contending.And now leave me, my mother! For as in my bosom I cherishWishes that are but vain, my life will be to no purpose.For I know that the Unit who makes a self-sacrifice, onlyInjures himself, unless all endeavour the Whole to accomplish."

모모"Now continue," replied forthwith his sensible mother:--"Tell me all that has happen'd, the least as w'ell as the greatestMen are always hasty, and only remember the last thing,And the hasty are easily forced from the road by obstructions.But a woman is skillful, and full of resources, and scorns notBye-roads to traverse when needed, well-skill'd to accomplish her purpose.Tell me then all, and why you are stirr'd by such violent feelingsMore than I ever have seen, while the blood is boiling within you,And from your eyes the tears against your will fain would fall now."

모모Then the youth gave way to his sorrow, and burst into weeping,Weeping aloud on the breast of his mother, and softly replying"Truly, my father's words to-day have wounded me sadly,Never have I deserved at his hands such treatment,--no, never!For to honour my parents was always my wish from my childhood,No one ever appear'd so prudent and wise as my parents,Who in the darker days of childhood carefully watch'd me.Much indeed it has been my lot to endure from my playmates,When with their knavish pranks they used to embitter my temper.Often I little suspected the tricks they were playing upon me:But if they happen'd to ridicule Father, whenever on SundaysOut of church he came with his slow deliberate footsteps,If they laugh'd at the strings of his cap, and his dressing-gown's flowers,Which he in stately wise wore, and to-day at length has discarded,Then in a fury I clench'd my fist, and, storming and raging,Fell upon them and hit and struck with terrible onslaught,Heedless where my blows fell. With bleeding noses they halloed,And could scarcely escape from the force of my blows and my kicking.Then, as in years I advanced, I had much to endure from my father,Who, in default of others to blame, would often abuse me,When at the Council's last sitting his anger perchance was excited,And I the penalty paid of the squabbles and strife of his colleagues.You yourself have oft pitied me; I endured it with patience,Always rememb'ring the much-to-be-honour'd kindness of parents,Whose only thought is to swell for our sakes their goods and possessions,And who deprive themselves of much, to save for their children.But, alas, not saving alone, for enjoyment hereafter,Constitutes happiness, no, not heaps of gold or of silver,Neither field upon field, however compact the estate be.For the father grows old, and his son at the same time grows older,Feeling no joy in To-day, and full of care for To-morrow.Now look down from this height, and see how beauteous before usLies the fair rich expanse, with vineyard and gardens at bottom;There are the stables and barns, and the rest of the property likewise;There I also descry the back of our house, in the gablesOf the roof may be seen the window of my small apartment.When I remember the time when I used to look out for the moon thereHalf through the night, or perchance at morning awaited the sunrise,When with but few hours of healthy sleep I was fully contented,Ah, how lonely do all things appear! My chamber, the court, andGarden, the beautiful field which spreads itself over the hillside;All appears but a desert to me: I still am unmarried!"Then his good mother answer'd his speech in a sensible manner"Son, your wish to be able to lead your bride to her chamber,Turning the night to the dearest and happiest half of your lifetime,Making your work by day more truly free and unfetter'd,Cannot be greater than that of your father and mother. We alwaysUrged you,--commanded, I even might say,--to choose some fair maiden.But I know full well, and my heart has told me alreadyIf the right hour arrives not, or if the right maiden appears notInstantly when they are sought for, man's choice is thrown in confusion,And he is driven by fear to seize what is counterfeit only.If I may tell you, my son, your choice already is taken,For your heart is smitten, and sensitive more than is usual.Answer me plainly, then, for my spirit already has told me:She whom now you have chosen is that poor emigrant maiden!"

모모"Yes, dear mother, you're right!" the son with vivacity answer'dYes, it is she! And unless this very day I conduct herHome as my bride, she will go on her way and escape me for ever,In the confusion of war, and in moving backwards and forwards.Mother, then before my eyes will in vain he unfoldedAll our rich estate, and each year henceforward be fruitful.Yes, the familiar house and the garden will be my aversion.Ah, and the love of my mother no comfort will give to my sorrow,For I feel that by Love each former bond must be loosen'd,When her own bonds she knits; 'tis not the maiden alone whoLeaves her father and mother behind, when she follows her husband.So it is with the youth; no more he knows mother and father.When he beholds the maiden, the only beloved one, approaching.Therefore let me go hence, to where desperation may lead me,For my father already has spoken in words of decision,And his house no longer is mine, if he shuts out the maidenWhom alone I would fain take home as my bride from henceforward."

모모Then the excellent sensible mother answer'd with quickness"Men are precisely like rocks when they stand opposed to each other!Proud and unyielding, the one will never draw near to the other.Neither will suffer his tongue to utter the first friendly accent.Therefore I tell you, my son, a hope still exists in my bosom,If she is worthy and good, he will give his consent to your marriage,Poor though she be, and although with disdain he refused you the poor thing.For in his hot-beaded fashion he utters many expressionsWhich he never intends; and so will accept the Refused One.But he requires kind words, and has a right to require them,For your father he is; his anger is all after dinner,When he more eagerly speaks, and questions the reasons of others,Meaning but little thereby; the wine then excites all the vigourOf his impetuous will, and prevents him from giving due weight toOther people's opinions; he hears and he feels his own only.But when evening arrives, the tone of the many discoursesWhich his friends and himself hold together, is very much alter'd.Milder becomes he, as soon as his liquor's effects have passed overAnd he feels the injustice his eagerness did unto others.Come, we will venture at once! Success the reward is of boldness,And we have need of the friends who now have assembled around him.--Most of all we shall want the help of our excellent pastor."Thus she eagerly spoke, and leaving the stone that she sat on,Also lifted her son from his seat. He willingly follow'd,And they descended in silence, revolving the weighty proposal.-----V. POLYHYMNIA.

모모THE COSMOPOLITE.

모모BUT the Three, as before, were still sitting and talking together,With the landlord, the worthy divine, and also the druggist,And the conversation still concern'd the same subject,Which in every form they had long been discussing together.Full of noble thoughts, the excellent pastor continued"I can't contradict you. I know 'tis the duty of mortalsEver to strive for improvement; and, as we may see, they strive alsoEver for that which is higher, at least what is new they seek after,But don't hurry too fast! For combined with these feelings, kind NatureAlso has given us pleasure in dwelling on that which is ancient,And in clinging to that to which we have long been accustom'd.Each situation is good that's accordant to nature and reason.Many things man desires, and yet he has need of but little;For but short are the days, and confined is the lot of a mortal.I can never blame the man who, active and restless,Hurries along, and explores each corner of earth and the oceanBoldly and carefully, while he rejoices at seeing the profitsWhich round him and his family gather themselves in abundance.But I also duly esteem the peaceable burgher,Who with silent steps his paternal inheritance paces,And watches over the earth, the seasons carefully noting.'Tis not every year that he finds his property alter'd;Newly-planted trees cannot stretch out their arms tow'rds the heavensAll in a moment, adorn'd with beautiful buds in abundance.No, a man has need of patience, he also has need ofPure unruffled tranquil thoughts and an intellect honest;For to the nourishing earth few seeds at a time he entrusteth,Few are the creatures he keeps at a time, with a view to their breeding,For what is Useful alone remains the first thought of his lifetime.Happy the man to whom Nature a mind thus attuned may have given!'Tis by him that we all are fed. And happy the townsmanOf the small town who unites the vocations of town and of country.He is exempt from the pressure by which the poor farmer is worried,Is not perplex'd by the citizens' cares and soaring ambition,Who, with limited means,--especially women and maidens,--Think of nothing but aping the ways of the great and the wealthy,You should therefore bless your son's disposition so peaceful,And the like-minded wife whom we soon may expect him to marry.

모모Thus he spoke. At that moment the mother and son stood before them.By the hand she led him and placed him in front of her husband"Father," she said, "how often have we, when talking together,Thought of that joyful day in the future, when Hermann, selectingAfter long waiting his bride at length would make us both happy!All kinds of projects we form'd. designing first one, then anotherGirl as his wife, as we talk'd in the manner that parents delight in.Now the day has arrived; and now has his bride been conductedHither and shown him by Heaven; his heart at length has decided.Were we not always saying that he should choose for himself, andWere you not lately wishing that he might feel for a maidenWarm and heart-felt emotions? And now has arrived the right moment!Yes, he has felt and has chosen, and like a man has decided.That fair maiden it is, the Stranger whom he encounter'd.Give her him; else he'll remain--he has sworn it--unmarried for ever."

모모And the son added himself:--"My father, O give her! My heart hasChosen purely and truly: she'll make you an excellent daughter."

모모But the father was silent. Then suddenly rose the good pastor,And address'd him as follows:--" One single moment's decisiveBoth of the life of a man, and of the whole of his Future.After lengthen'd reflection, each resolution made by himIs but the work of a moment; the prudent alone seize the right one.Nothing more dangerous is, in making a choice, than revolvingFirst this point and then that, and so confusing the feelings.Pure is Hermann's mind; from his youth I have known him; he never,Even in boyhood, was wont to extend his hand hither and thither.What he desired, was suitable to him; he held to it firmly.Be not astonish'd and scared, because there appears on a suddenWhat you so long have desired. 'Tis true the appearance at presentBears not the shape of the wish, as you in your mind had conceived it.For our wishes conceal the thing that we wish for; our gifts tooCome from above upon us, each clad in its own proper figure.Do not now mistake the maiden who has succeededFirst in touching the heart of your good wise son, whom you love so.Happy is he who is able to clasp the hand of his first love,And whose dearest wish is not doom'd to pine in his bosom!Yes, I can see by his face, already his fate is decided;True affection converts the youth to a man in a moment.He little changeable is; I fear me, if this you deny him,All the fairest years of his life will be changed into sorrow."

모모Then in prudent fashion the druggist, who long had been wantingHis opinion to give, rejoin'd in the following manner"This is Just a case when the middle course is the wisest!'Hasten slowly,' you know, was the motto of Caesar Augustus.I am always ready to be of use to my neighbours,And to turn to their profit what little wits I can boast of.Youth especially needs the guidance of those who are older.Let me then depart; I fain would prove her, that maiden,And will examine the people 'mongst whom she lives, and who know her.I am not soon deceived; I know how to rate their opinions."

모모Then forthwith replied the son, with eagerness speaking:--"Do so, neighbour, and go, make your inquiries. However,I should greatly prefer that our friend, the pastor, went with you;Two such excellent men are witnesses none can find fault with.O, my father! the maiden no vagabond is, I assure you,No mere adventurer, wand'ring about all over the country,And deceiving the inexperienced youths with her cunning;No! the harsh destiny link'd with this war, so destructive of all things,Which is destroying the world, and already has wholly uprootedMany a time-honour'd fabric, has driven the poor thing to exile.Are not brave men of noble birth now wand'ring in mis'ry?Princes are fleeing disguised, and monarchs in banishment living.Ah, and she also herself, the best of her sisters, is drivenOut of her native land; but her own misfortunes forgetting,Others she seeks to console, and, though helpless, is also most helpful.Great are the woes and distress which over the earth's face are brooding,But may happiness not be evoked from out of this sorrow?May not I, in the arms of my bride, the wife I have chosen,Even rejoice at the war, as you at the great conflagration?"

모모Then replied the father, and open'd his mouth with importance:--"Strangely indeed, my son, has your tongue been suddenly loosen'd,Which for years has stuck in your mouth, and moved there but rarelyI to-day must experience that which threatens each father:How the ardent will of a son a too-gentle motherWillingly favours, whilst each neighbour is ready to back him,Only provided it be at the cost of a father or husband!But what use would it be to resist so many together?For I see that defiance and tears will otherwise greet me.Go and prove her, and in God's name then hasten to bring herHome as my daughter; if not, he must think no more of the maiden."

모모Thus spake the father. The son exclaim'd with jubilant gesture"Ere the ev'ning arrives, you shall have the dearest of daughters,Such as the man desires whose bosom is govern'd by prudenceAnd I venture to think the good creature is fortunate also.Yes, she will ever be grateful that I her father and motherHave restored her in you, as sensible children would wish it.But I will loiter no longer; I'll straightway harness the horses,And conduct our friends on the traces of her whom I love so,Leave the men to themselves and their own intuitive wisdom,And be guided alone by their decision--I swear it,--And not see the maiden again, until she my own is."Then he left the house; meanwhile the others were eagerlySettling many a point, and the weighty matter debating.

모모Hermann sped to the stable forthwith, where the spirited stallionsTranquilly stood and with eagerness swallow'd the pure oats before them,And the well-dried hay, which was cut from the best of their meadows.Then in eager haste in their mouths the shining bits placed he,Quickly drew the harness through the well-plated buckles,And then fastend the long broad reins in proper position,Led the horses out in the yard, where already the carriage,Easily moved along by its pole, had been push'd by the servant.Then they restrain'd the impetuous strength of the fast-moving horses,Fastening both with neat-looking ropes to the bar of the carriage.Hermann seized his whip, took his seat, and drove to the gateway.When in the roomy carriage his friends had taken their places,Swiftly he drove away, and left the pavement behind them,Left behind the walls of the town and the clean-looking towers,Thus sped Hermann along, till he reach'd the familiar highway,Not delaying a moment, and galloping uphill and downhill.When however at length the village steeple descried he,And not far away lay the houses surrounded by gardens,He began to think it was time to hold in the horses.

모모By the time-honour'd gloom of noble lime-trees o'er shadow'd,Which for many a century past on the spot had been rooted,Stood there a green and spreading grass-plot in front of the village,Cover'd with turf, for the peasants and neighbouring townsmen a playground.Scooped out under the trees, to no great depth, stood a fountain.On descending the steps, some benches of stone might be seen there,Ranged all around the spring, which ceaselessly well'd forth its waters,Cleanly, enclosed by a low wall all round, and convenient to draw from.Hermann then determined beneath the shadow his horsesWith the carriage to stop. He did so, and spoke then as follows"Now, my friends, get down, and go by yourselves to discoverWhether the maiden is worthy to have the hand which I offer.I am convinced that she is; and you'll bring me no new or strange story:Had I to manage alone, I would straightway go off to the village,And in few words should my fate by the charming creature be settled.

모모Her you will easily recognize 'mongst all the rest of the people,For her appearance is altogether unlike that of others.But I will now describe the modest dress she is wearing:--First a bodice red her well-arch'd bosom upraises,Prettily tied, while black are the stays fitting closely around her.Then the seams of the ruff she has carefully plaited and folded,Which with modest grace, her chin so round is encircling.Free and joyously rises her head with its elegant oval,Strongly round bodkins of silver her back-hair is many times twistedHer blue well-plaited gown begins from under her bodice.And as she walks envelopes her well-turn'd ankles completely.But I have one thing to say, and this must expressly entreat you:Do not speak to the maiden, and let not your scheme be discover'd.But inquire of others, and hearken to all that they tell you,When you have learnt enough to satisfy father and mother,Then return to me straight, and we'll settle future proceedings.This is the plan which I have matured, while driving you hither."

모모Thus he spoke, and the friends forthwith went on to the village,Where, in gardens and barns and houses, the multitude crowded;All along the broad road the numberless carts were collected,Men were feeding the lowing cattle and feeding the horses.Women on every hedge the linen were carefully drying,Whilst the children in glee were splashing about in the streamlet.Forcing their way through the waggons, and past the men and the cattle,Walk'd the ambassador spies, looking well to the righthand and lefthand,Hoping somewhere to see the form of the well-described maiden;But wherever they look'd, no trace of the girl they discover'd.

모모Presently denser became the crowd. Round some of the waggons.Men in a passion were quarrelling, women also were screaming.Then of a sudden approach'd an aged man with firm footstepMarching straight up to the fighters; and forthwith was hush'd the contention,When he bade them be still, and with fatherly earnestness threaten'd."Are we not yet," he exclaim'd, "by misfortune so knitted together,As to have learnt at length the art of reciprocal patienceAnd toleration, though each cannot measure the actions of others?Prosperous men indeed may quarrel! Will sorrow not teach youHow no longer as formerly you should quarrel with brethren?Each should give way to each other, when treading the soil of the stranger,And, as you hope for mercy yourselves, you should share your possessions."

모모Thus the man address'd them, and all were silent. In peacefulHumour the reconciled men look'd after their cattle and waggons.When the pastor heard the man discourse in this fashion,And the foreign magistrate's peaceful nature discovered,He approach'd him in turn, and used this significant language"Truly, Father, when nations are living in days of good fortune,Drawing their food from the earth, which gladly opens its treasures,And its wish'd-for gifts each year and each month is renewing,Then all matters go smoothly; each thinks himself far the wisest,And the best, and so they exist by the side of each other,And the most sensible man no better than others is reckon'dFor the world moves on, as if by itself and in silence.But when distress unsettles our usual manner of living,Pulls down each time-honour'd fabric, and roots up the seed in our gardens,Drives the man and his wife far away from the home they delight in,Hurries them off in confusion through days and nights full of anguish,Ah! then look we around in search of the man who is wisest,And no longer in vain he utters his words full of wisdom.Tell me whether you be these fugitives' magistrate, Father,Over whose minds you appear to possess such an influence soothing?Aye, to-day I could deem you one of the leaders of old time,Who through wastes and through deserts conducted the wandering people;I could imagine 'twas Joshua I am addressing, or Moses."

모모Then with solemn looks the magistrate answer'd as follows"Truly the present times resemble the strangest of old times,Which are preserved in the pages of history, sacred or common.He in these days who has lived to-day and yesterday only,Many a year has lived, events so crowd on each other.When I reflect back a little, a grey old age I could fancyOn my head to be lying, and yet my strength is still active.Yes, we people in truth may liken ourselves to those othersUnto whom in a fiery bush appear'd, in a solemnMoment, the Lord our God; in fire and clouds we behold him."

모모When the pastor would fain continue to speak on this subject,And was anxious to learn the fate of the man and his party,Quickly into his ear his companion secretly whisper'd"Speak for a time with the magistrate, turning your talk on the maiden,Whilst I wander about, endeav'ring to find her. DirectlyI am successful, I'll join you again." Then nodded the pastor,And the spy went to seek her, in barns and through hedges and gardens.-----VI. KLIO.

모모THE AGE.

모모WHEN the pastor ask'd the foreign magistrate questions,What the people had suffer'd, how long from their homes they had wander'd,Then the man replied:--"By no means short are our sorrows,For we have drunk the bitters of many a long year together,All the more dreadful, because our fairest hopes have been blighted.Who can deny that his heart beat wildly and high in his bosomAnd that with purer pulses his breast more freely was throbbing,When the newborn sun first rose in the whole of its glory,When we heard of the right of man, to have all things in common,Heard of noble Equality, and of inspiriting Freedom!Each man then hoped to attain new life for himself, and the fettersWhich had encircled many a land appear'd to be broken,Fetters held by the hands of sloth and selfish indulgence.Did not all nations turn their gaze, in those days of emotion,Tow'rds the world's capital, which so many a long year had been so,And then more than ever deserved a name so distinguish'd?Were not the men, who first proclaim'd so noble a message,Names that are worthy to rank with the highest the sun ever shone on,Did not each give to mankind his courage and genius and language?

모모"And we also, as neighbours, at first were warmly excited.Presently after began the war, and the train of arm'd FrenchmenNearer approach'd; at first they appear'd to bring with them friendship,And they brought it in fact; for all their souls were exalted.And the gay trees of liberty ev'rywhere gladly they planted,Promising unto each his own, and the government long'd for.Greatly at this was youth, and greatly old age was delighted,And the joyous dance began round the newly-raised standards.In this manner the overpowering Frenchmen soon conquer'dFirst the minds of the men, with their fiery lively proceedings,Then the hearts of the women, with irresistible graces.Even the strain of the war, with its many demands, seem'd but trifling,For before our eyes the distance by hope was illumined,Luring our gaze far ahead into paths now first open'd before us."O how joyful the time, when with his bride the glad bridegroomWhirls in the dance, awaiting the day that will join them for everBut more glorious far was the time when the Highest of all thingsWhich man's mind can conceive, close by and attainable seemed.Then were the tongues of all loosen'd, and words of wisdom and feelingNot by greybeards alone, but by men and by striplings were utter'd.

모모"But the heavens soon clouded became. For the sake of the mast'ryStrove a contemptible crew, unfit to accomplish good actions.Then they murder'd each other, and took to oppressing their new-foundNeighbours and brothers, and sent on missions whole herds of self캅eekersAnd the superiors took to carousing and robbing by wholesale,And the inferiors down to the lowest caroused and robb'd also.Nobody thought of aught else than having enough for tomorrow.Terrible was the distress, and daily increased the oppression.None the cry understood, that they of the day were the masters.Then even temperate minds were attack'd by sorrow and fury;Each one reflected, and swore to avenge all the injuries suffer'd,And to atone for the hitter loss of hopes twice defrauded.Presently Fortune declared herself on the side of the Germans,And the French were compell'd to retreat by forced marches before them.Ah! the sad fate of the war we then for the first time experienced.For the victor is kind and humane, at least he appears so,And he spares the man he has vanquish'd, as if he his own were,When he employs him daily, and with his property helps him.But the fugitive knows no law; he wards off death only,And both quickly and recklessly all that he meets with, consumes he.Then his mind becomes heated apace; and soon desperationFills his heart, and impels him to all kinds of criminal actions.Nothing then holds he respected, he steals It. With furious longingOn the woman he rushes; his lust becomes awful to think of.Death all around him he sees, his last minutes in cruelty spends he,Wildly exulting in blood, and exulting in howls and in anguish.

모모"Then in the minds of our men arose a terrible yearningThat which was lost to avenge, and that which remain'd to defend still.All of them seized upon arms, lured on by the fugitives' hurry,By their pale faces, and by their shy, uncertain demeanour.There was heard the sound of alarm-bells unceasingly ringing,And the approach of danger restrain'd not their violent fury.Soon into weapons were turn'd the implements peaceful of tillage,And with dripping blood the scythe and the pitchfork were cover'd.Every foeman without distinction was ruthlessly slaughter'd,Fury was ev'rywhere raging, and artful, cowardly weakness.May I never again see men in such wretched confusion!Even the raging wild beast is a better object to gaze on.Ne'er let them speak of freedom, as if themselves they could govern!All the evil which Law has driven farback in the cornerSeems to escape, as soon as the fetters which bound it are loosen'd."

모모"Excellent man," replied the pastor, with emphasis speaking"If you're mistaken in man, 'tis not for me to reprove you.Evil enough have you suffer'd indeed from his cruel proceedings!Would you but look back, however, on days so laden with sorrow,You would yourself confess how much that is good you have witness'd,Much that is excellent, which remains conceald in the bossomTill by danger 'tis stirr'd, and till necessity makes manShow himself as an angel, a tutelar God unto others."

모모Then with a smile replied the worthy old magistrate, saying"Your reminder is wise, like that which they give to the suff'rerWho has had his dwelling burnt down, that under the ruins,Gold and silver are lying, though melted and cover'd with ashes.Little, indeed, it may be, and yet that little is precious,And the poor man digs it up, and rejoices at finding the treasure.Gladly, therefore, I turn my thoughts to those few worthy actionsWhich my memory still is able to dwell on with pleasure.Yes, I will not deny it, I saw late foemen unitingSo as to save the town from harm; I saw with devotionParents, children and friends impossible actions attempting,Saw how the youth of a sudden became a man, how the greybeardOnce more was young, how the child as a stripling appear'd in a moment.Aye, and the weaker sex, as people commonly call it,Show'd itself brave and daring, with presence of mind all-unwonted.Let me now, in the first place, describe a deed of rare meritBy a high-spirited girl accomplish'd, an excellent maiden,Who in the great farmhouse remain'd behind with the servants,When the whole of the men had departed, to fight with the strangers.Well, there fell on the court a troop of vagabond scoundrels,Plund'ring and forcing their way inside the rooms of the women.Soon they cast their eyes on the forms of the grown-up fair maidenAnd of the other dear girls, in age little more than mere children.Hurried away by raging desire, unfeelingly rush'd theyOn the trembling band, and on the high-spirited maiden.But she instantly seized the sword from the side of a ruffian,Hew'd him down to the ground; at her feet straight fell he, all bleeding,Then with doughty strokes the maidens she bravely deliver'd.Wounded four more of the robbers; with life, however, escaped they.Then she lock'd up the court, and, arm'd still, waited for succour.

모모When the pastor heard the praise of the maiden thus utter'dFeelings of hope for his friend forthwith arose in his bosom,And he prepared to ask what had been the fate of the damsel,Whether she, in the sorrowful flight, form'd one of the people?At this moment, however, the druggist nimbly approach'd them,Pull'd the sleeve of the pastor, and whisper'd to him as follows"I have at last pick'd out the maiden from many a hundredBy her description! Pray come and judge for yourself with your own eyes;Bring the magistrate with you, that we may learn the whole story."

모모So they turn'd themselves round; but the magistrate found himself summon'dBy his own followers, who had need of his presence and counsel.But the pastor forthwith the druggist accompanied, till theyCame to a gap in the hedge, when the latter pointed with slyness,"See you," exclaim'd he, "the maiden? The child's clothes she has been changing.And I recognise well the old calico--also the cushion--Cover of blue, which Hermann took in the bundle and gave her.Quickly and well, of a truth, she has used the presents left with her.These are evident proofs; and all the rest coincide too;For a bodice red her well-arch'd bosom upraises,Prettily tied, while black are the stays fitting close around her.Then the seams of the ruff she has carefully plaited and folded,Which, with modest grace, her chin so round is encircling;Free and joyously rises her head, with its elegant oval,Strongly round bodkins of silver her back-hair is many times twisted.When she is sitting, we plainly see her noble proportions,And the blue well-plaited gown which begins from close to her bosom,And in rich folds descending, her well-turn'd ankles envelops.'Tis she, beyond all doubt. So come, that we may examineWhether she be both a good and a frugal and virtuous maiden."Then the pastor rejoin'd, the sitting damsel inspecting"That she enchanted the youth, I confess is no matter of wonder,For she stands the test of the gaze of a man of experience.Happy the person to whom Mother Nature the right face has given!She recommends him at all times, he never appears as a stranger,Each one gladly approaches, and each one beside him would linger,If with his face is combined a pleasant and courteous demeanour.Yes, I assure you the youth has indeed discover'd a maidenWho the whole of the days of his life will enliven with gladness,And with her womanly strength assist him at all times and truly.Thus a perfect body preserves the soul also in pureness,And a vigorous youth of a happy old age gives assurance.

모모After reflecting a little, the druggist made answer as follows:--"Yet appearances oft are deceitful. I trust not the outside.Often, indeed, have I found the truth of the proverb which tells usEre you share a bushel of salt with a new-found acquaintance,Do not trust him too readily; time will make you more certainHow you and he will get on, and whether your friendship is lasting.Let us then, in the first place, inquire amongst the good peopleUnto whom the maiden is known, who can tell us about her."

모모"Well, of a truth I commend your prudence," the pastor continued"Not for ourselves are we wooing! To woo for others is serious."So they started to meet the worthy magistrate seeingHow in the course of his business he was ascending the main street.And the wise pastor straightway address'd him with foresight as follows"We, by-the-bye, have just seen a girl in the neighbouring gardenUnder an apple-tree sitting, and clothes for the children preparing,Made of worn calico, which for the purpose was doubtless presented.We were pleased by her face; she appears to be one of the right sort.Tell us, what know you about her? We ask from a laudable motive."

모모When the magistrate came to the garden and peep'd in, exclaimed he"Well do I know her, in truth; for when I told you the storyOf that noble deed which was done by the maiden I spoke of,How she seized on the sword, and defended herself, and the servants,She the heroine was! You can see how active her nature.But she's as good as she's strong; for her aged kinsman she tendedUntil the time of his death, for he died overwhelm'd by afflictionAt the distress of his town, and the danger his goods were exposed to.Also with mute resignation she bore the grievous afflictionOf her betroth'd's sad death, a noble young man who, incitedBy the first fire of noble thoughts to struggle for freedom,Went himself to Paris, and soon found a terrible death there.For, as at home, so there, he fought 'gainst intrigue and oppression."

모모Thus the magistrate spoke. The others departed and thanked him,And the pastor produced a gold piece (the silver his purse heldHe some hours before had with genuine kindness expendedWhen he saw the fugitives passing in sorrowful masses).

모모And to the magistrate handed it, saying:--" Divide it, I pray you,'Mongst those who need it the most. May God give it prosperous increase."

모모But the man refused to accept it, and said:--"I assure you,Many a dollar we've saved, and plenty of clothing and such things,And I trust we may reach our homes before they are finish'd."

모모Then continued the pastor, the gold in his hand once more placing"None should delay to give in days like the present, and no oneOught to refuse to receive what is offer'd with liberal kindness.No one can tell how long he will keep what in peace he possesses,No one, how long he is doom'd in foreign countries to wander,While he's deprived of the field and the garden by which he is nurtured."

모모"Bravo!" added in turn the druggist, with eagerness speaking"Had I but money to spare in my pocket, you surely should have it,Silver and gold alike; for your followers certainly need it.Yet I'll not leave you without a present, if only to show youMy good will, and I hope you will take the will for the action."Thus he spoke, and pull'd out by the strings the leather embroider'dPouch, in which he was wont his stock of tobacco to carry,Daintily open'd and shared its contents--some two or three pipes' full."Small in truth is the gift," he added. The magistrate answered:"Good tobacco is always a welcome present to trav'llers."Then the druggist began his canister to praise very highly.But the pastor drew him away, and the magistrate left them."Come, let us hasten!" exclaimed the sensible man, "for our young friendAnxiously waits; without further delay let him hear the good tidings."

모모So they hasten'd and came, and found that the youngster was leaning'Gainst his carriage under the lime-trees. The horses were pawingWildly the turf; he held them in check and stood there all pensive,Silently gazing in front, and saw not his friends coming near him,Till, as they came, they called him and gave him signals of triumph.Some way off the druggist already began to address him,But they approach'd the youth still nearer, and then the good pastorSeized his hand and spoke and took the word from his comrade"Friend, I wish you joy! Your eye so true and your true heartRightly have chosen! May you and the wife of your young days be happy!She is full worthy of you; so come and turn around the carriage,That we may reach without delay the end of the village,So as to woo her, and shortly escort the dear creature home with us."But the youth stood still, and without any token of pleasureHeard the words of the envoy, though sounding consoling and heav'nly,Deeply sigh'd and said:--"We came full speed in the carriageAnd shall probably go back home ashamed and but slowly;For, since I have been waiting care has fallen upon me,Doubt and suspicion and all that a heart full of love is exposed to.Do you suppose we have only to come, for the maiden to follow,Just because we are rich, and she poor and wandering in exile?Poverty, when undeserved, itself makes proud. The fair maidenSeems to be active and frugal; the world she may claim as her portion.Do you suppose that a woman of such great beauty and mannersCan have grown up without exciting love in man's bosom?Do you suppose that her heart until now has to love been fast closed?Do not drive thither in haste, for perchance to our shame and confusionWe shall have slowly to turn towards home the heads of our horses.Yes, some youth, I fear me, possesses her heart, and alreadyShe has doubtless promised her hand and her solemn troth plighted,And I shall stand all ashamed before her, When making my offer."

모모Then the pastor proceeded to cheer him with words of good comfort,But his companion broke in, in his usual talkative manner"As things used to be, this embarrassment would not have happened,When each matter was brought to a close in an orthodox fashion.Then for their son themselves the bride the parents selected,And a friend of the house was secretly call'd in the first place.He was then quietly sent as a suitor to visit the parentsOf the selected bride; and, dress'd in his gayest apparel,Went after dinner some Sunday to visit the excellent burgher,And began by exchanging polite remarks on all subjects,Cleverly turning and bending the talk in the proper direction.After long beating about the bush, he flatter'd the daughter,And spoke well of the man and the house that gave his commission.Sensible people soon saw his drift, and the sensible envoyWatch'd how the notion was taken, and then could explain himself farther.If they declined the proposal, why then the refusal cost nothing,But if all prosper'd, why then the suitor for ever thereafterPlay'd the first fiddle at every family feast and rejoicing.For the married couple remember'd the whole of their lifetimeWhose was the skilful hand by which the marriage knot tied was.All this now is chang'd, and with many an excellent customHas gone quite out of fashion. Each person woos for himself now.Everyone now must bear the weight of a maiden's refusalOn his own shoulders, and stand all ashamed before her, if needs be."

모모"Let that be as it may," then answered the young man who scarcelyHeard what was said, and his mind had made up already in silence"I will go myself, and out of the mouth of the maidenLearn my own fate, for towards her I cherish the most trustful feelingsThat any man ever cherish'd towards any woman whatever.That which she says will be good and sensible,--this I am sure of.If I am never to see her again, I must once more behold her,And the ingenuous gaze of her black eyes must meet for the last time.If to my heart I may clasp her never, her bosom and shouldersI would once more see, which my arm so longs to encircle:Once more the mouth I would see, from which one kiss and a Yes willMake me happy for ever, a No for ever undo me.But now leave me alone! Wait here no longer. Return youStraight to my father and mother, in order to tell them in personThat their son was right, and that the maiden is worthy.And so leave me alone! I myself shall return by the footpathOver the hill by the pear-tree and then descend through the vineyard,Which is the shortest way back. Oh may I soon with rejoicingTake the beloved one home! But perchance all alone I must slink backBy that path to our house and tread it no more with a light heart."Thus he spoke, and then placed the reins in the hands of the pastor,Who, in a knowing way both the foaming horses restraining,Nimbly mounted the carriage, and took the seat of the driver.

모모But you still delay'd, good cautious neighbour, and spoke thusFriend, I will gladly entrust to you soul, and spirit, and mind too,But my body and bones are not preserved in the best wayWhen the hand of a parson such worldly matters as reins grasps!"

모모But you smiled in return, you sensible pastor, replying"Pray jump in, nor fear with both body and spirit to trust me,For this hand to hold the reins has long been accustom'd,And these eyes are train'd to turn the corner with prudence.For we were wont to drive the carriage, when living at Strasburg,At the time when with the young baron I went there, for daily,Driven by me, through the echoing gateway thunder'd the carriageBy the dusty roads to distant meadows and lindens,Through the crowds of the people who spend their lifetime in walking."

모모Partially comforted, then his neighbour mounted the carriage,Sitting like one prepared to make a wise jump, if needs be,And the stallions, eager to reach their stables, coursed homewards,While beneath their powerful hoofs the dust rose in thick clouds.Long there stood the youth, and saw the dust rise before him,Saw the dust disperse; but still he stood there, unthinking.-----VII. ERATO.

모모DOROTHEA.

모모As the man on a journey, who, just at the moment of sunset,Fixes his gaze once more on the rapidly vanishing planet,Then on the side of the rocks and in the dark thicket still sees heHov'ring its image; wherever he turns his looks, on in front stillRuns it, and glitters and wavers before him in colours all splendid,So before Hermanns eyes did the beautiful form of the maidenSoftly move, and appear'd to follow the path through the cornfields.

모모But he roused himself up from his startling dream, and then slowlyTurn'd tow'rd the village his steps, and once more started,--for once moreSaw he the noble maiden's stately figure approaching.Fixedly gazed he; it was no phantom in truth; she herself 'twasIn her hands by the handle she carried two pitchers,--one larger,One of a smaller size, and nimbly walk'd to the fountain.And he joyfully went to meet her; the sight of her gave himCourage and strength, and so he address'd the surprised one as follows:--"Do I find you again, brave maiden, engaged in assistingOthers so soon, and in giving refreshment to those who may need it?Tell me why you have come all alone to the spring so far distant,Whilst the rest are content with the water that's found in the village?This one, indeed, special virtue possesses, and pleasant to drink is.Is't for the sake of that sick one you come, whom you saved with such courage?"

모모Then the good maiden the youth in friendly fashion saluted,Saying:--"Already my walk to the fountain is fully rewarded,Since I have found the kind person who gave us so many good presents;For the sight of a giver, like that of a gift, is refreshing.Come and see for yourself the persons who tasted your kindness,And receive the tranquil thanks of all you have aided.But that you may know the reason why I have come here,Water to draw at a spot where the spring is both pure and unceasing,I must inform you that thoughtless men have disturb'd all the waterFound in the village, by carelessly letting the horses and oxenWade about in the spring which give the inhabitants water.In the same manner, with all their washing and cleaning they've dirtiedAll the troughs of the village, and all the fountains have sullied.For each one of them only thinks how quickly and soon heMay supply his own wants, and cares not for those who come after."

모모Thus she spoke, and soon she arrived at the foot of the broad stepsWith her companion, and both of them sat themselves down on the low wallRound the spring. She bent herself over, to draw out the water,He the other pitcher took up, and bent himself over,And in the blue of the heavens they saw their figures reflected,Waving, and nodding, and in the mirror their greetings exchanging."Now let me drink," exclaim'd the youth in accents of gladness.And she gave him the pitcher. They then, like old friends, sat together,Leaning against the vessels, when she address'd him as follows"Say, why find I you here without your carriage and horses,Far from the place where first I saw you. Pray how came you hither?"

모모Hermann thoughtfully gazed on the ground, but presently liftedCalmly towards her his glances, and gazed on her face in kind fashion,Feeling quite calm and composed. And yet with love to address herFound he quite out of the question; for love from her eyes was not beaming,But an intellect clear, which bade him use sensible language.Soon he collected his thoughts, and quietly said to the maiden:--"Let me speak, my child, and let me answer your questions."'Tis for your sake alone I have come,--why seek to conceal it?For I happily live with two affectionate parents,Whom I faithfully help to look after our house and possessions,Being an only son, while numerous are our employments.I look after the field work; the house is carefully managedBy my father; my mother the hostelry cheers and enlivens.But you also have doubtless found out how greatly the servants,Sometimes by fraud, and sometimes by levity, worry their mistress,Constantly making her change them, and barter one fault for another.Long has my mother, therefore, been wanting a girl in the household,Who, not only with hand, but also with heart might assist her,In the place of the daughter she lost, alas, prematurely.Now when I saw you to-day near the carriage, so active and sprightly,Saw the strength of your arm and the perfect health of your members,When I heard your sensible words, I was struck with amazement,And I hasten'd back home, deservedly praising the strangerBoth to my parents and friends. And now I come to inform youWhat they desire, as I do. Forgive my stammering language!"

모모"Do not hesitate," said she, "to tell me the rest of your storyI have with gratitude felt that you have not sought to insult me.Speak on boldly, I pray; your words shall never alarm me;You would fain hire me now as maid to your father and mother,To look after the house, which now is in excellent order.And you think that in me you have found a qualified maiden,One that is able to work, and not of a quarrelsome nature.Your proposal was short, and short shall my answer be alsoYes! with you I will go, and the voice of my destiny follow.I have fulfill'd my duty, and brought the lying-in womanBack to her friends again, who all rejoice at her rescue.Most of them now are together, the rest will presently join them.All expect that they, in a few short days, will be ableHomewards to go; 'tis thus that exiles themselves love to flatter.But I cannot deceive myself with hopes so delusiveIn these sad days which promise still sadder days in the futureFor all the bonds of the world are loosen'd, and nought can rejoin them,Save that supreme necessity over our future impending.If in the house of so worthy a man I can earn my own living,Serving under the eye of his excellent wife, I will do so;For a wandering girl bears not the best reputation.Yes! with you I will go, as soon as I've taken the pitcherBack to my friends, and received the blessing of those worthy people.Come! you needs must see them, and from their hands shall receive me."

모모Joyfully heard the youth the willing maiden's decision,Doubting whether he now had not better tell her the whole truth;But it appear'd to him best to let her remain in her error,First to take her home, and then for her love to entreat her.Ah! but now he espied a golden ring on her finger,And so let her speak, while he attentively listen'd:--

모모"Let us now return," she continued, "the custom is alwaysTo admonish the maidens who tarry too long at the fountain,Yet how delightful it is by the fast-flowing water to chatter!"Then they both arose, and once more directed their glancesInto the fountain, and then a blissful longing came o'er them.

모모So from the ground by the handles she silently lifted the pitchers,Mounted the steps of the well, and Hermann follow'd the loved one.One of the pitchers he ask'd her to give him, thus sharing the burden."Leave it," she said, "the weight feels less when thus they are balanced;And the master I've soon to obey, should not be my servant.Gaze not so earnestly at me, as if my fate were still doubtfull!Women should learn betimes to serve, according to station,For by serving alone she attains at last to the mast'ry,To the due influence which she ought to possess in the household.Early the sister must learn to serve her brothers and parents,And her life is ever a ceaseless going and coming,Or a lifting and carrying, working and doing for others.Well for her, if she finds no manner of life too offensive,And if to her the hours of night and of day all the same are,So that her work never seems too mean, her needle too pointed,So that herself she forgets, and liveth only for others!For as a mother in truth she needs the whole of the virtues,When the suckling awakens the sick one, and nourishment calls forFrom the exhausted parent, heaping cares upon suff'ring.Twenty men together could not endure such a burden,And they ought not,--and yet they gratefully ought to behold it."

모모Thus she spoke, and with her silent companion advanced sheThrough the garden, until the floor of the granary reach'd they,Where the sick woman lay, whom she left by her daughters attended,Those dear rescued maidens, the types of innocent beauty.Both of them enter'd the room, and from the other direction,Holding a child in each hand, her friend, the magistrate, enter'd.These had lately been lost for some time by the sorrowing mother,But the old man had now found them out in the crowd of the people.And they sprang in with joy, to greet their dearly-loved mother,To rejoice in a brother, the playmate now seen for the first time!

모모Then on Dorothea they sprang, and greeted her warmly,Asking for bread and fruit, but asking for drink before all things.And they handed the water all round. The children first drank some,Then the sick woman drank, with her daughters, the magistrate also.All were refresh'd, and sounded the praise of the excellent water;Mineral was it, and very reviving, and wholesome for drinking.

모모Then with a serious look continued the maiden, and spoke thusFriends, to your mouths for the last time in truth I have lifted the pitcher,And for the last time, alas, have moisten'd your lips with pure water.But whenever in scorching heat your drink may refresh you,And in the shade you enjoy repose and a fountain unsullied,Then remember me, and all my friendly assistance,Which I from love, and not from relationship merely have render'd.All your kindness to me, as long as life lasts, I'll remember,I unwillingly leave you; but each one is now to each otherRather a burden than comfort. We all must shortly be scatter'dOver a foreign land, unless to return we are able.See, here stands the youth to whom for those gifts we're indebted,All those clothes for the child, and all those acceptable viands.Well, he has come, and is anxious that I to his house should go with him,There as a servant to act to his rich and excellent parents,And I have not refused him, for serving appears my vocation,And to be served by others at home would seem like a burden.So I'll go willingly with him; the youth appears to be prudent,Thus will his parents be properly cared for, as rich people should be.Therefore, now, farewell, my much-loved friend, and be joyfulIn your living infant, who looks so healthily at you.When you press him against your bosom, wrapp'd up in those colourdSwaddling-clothes, then remember the youth who so kindly bestow'd them,And who in future will feed and clothe me also, your loved friend.You too, excellent man," to the magistrate turning, she added"Warmly I thank for so often acting the part of a father."

모모Then she knelt herself down before the lying-in patient,Kiss'd the weeping woman, her whisper'd blessing receiving.Meanwhile the worthy magistrate spoke to Hermann as follows"You deserve, my friend to be counted amongst the good landlordsWho are anxious to manage their house through qualified people.For I have often observed how cautiously men are accustom'dSheep and cattle and horses to watch, when buying or bart'ringBut a man, who's so useful, provided he's good and efficient,And who does so much harm and mischief by treacherous dealings,Him will people admit to their houses by chance and haphazard,And too late find reason to rue an o'erhasty decision.This you appear to understand, for a girl you have chosenAs your servant, and that of your parents, who thoroughly good is.Treat her well, and as long as she finds the business suit her,You will not miss your sister, your parents will miss not their daughter."

모모Other persons now enter'd, the patient's nearest relations,Many articles bringing, and better lodgings announcing.All were inform'd of the maiden's decision, and warmly bless'd Hermann,Both with significant looks, and also with grateful expressions,And one secretly whispered into the ear of another"If the master should turn to a bridegroom, her home is provided."Hermann then presently took her hand, and address'd her as follows"Let us be going; the day is declining, and far off the village."Then the women, with lively expressions, embraced Dorothea;Hermann drew her away; they still continued to greet her.Next the children, with screams and terrible crying attack'd her,Pulling her clothes, their second mother refusing to part from.But first one of the women, and then another rebuked them"Children, hush! to the town she is going, intending to bring youPlenty of gingerbread back, which your brother already had order'd,From the confectioner, when the stork was passing there lately,And she'll soon return, with papers prettily gilded."

모모So at length the children released her; but scarcely could HermannTear her from their embraces and distant-signalling kerchiefs.-----VIII. MELPOMENE.

모모HERMANN AND DOROTHEA.

모모So tow'rd the sun, now fast sinking to rest, the two walk'd together,Whilst he veil'd himself deep in clouds which thunder portended.Out-of his veil now here, now there, with fiery glancesBeaming over the plain with rays foreboding and lurid."May this threatening weather," said Hermann, "not bring to us shortlyHail and violent rain, for well does the harvest now promise."And they both rejoiced in the corn so lofty and waving,Well nigh reaching the heads of the two tall figures that walk'd there.Then the maiden spoke to her friendly leader as follows"Generous youth, to whom I shall owe a kind destiny shortly,Shelter and home, when so many poor exiles must weather the tempest,In the first place tell me all about your good parents,Whom I intend to serve with all my soul from hence-forward;Knowing one's master, 'tis easier far to give satisfaction,By rememb'ring the things which he deems of the highest importance,And on which he has set his heart with the greatest decision.Tell me, then, how best I can win your father and mother."

모모Then the good and sensible youth made answer as follows"You are indeed quite right, my kind and excellent maiden,To begin by asking about the tastes of my parents!For I have hitherto striven in vain to satisfy Father,When I look'd after the inn, as well as my regular duty,Working early and late in the field, and tending the vineyard.Mother indeed was contented; she knew how to value my efforts;And she will certainly hold you to be an excellent maiden,If you take care of the house, as though the dwelling your own were.But my father's unlike her; he's fond of outward appearance.Gentle maiden, deem me not cold and void of all feeling,If I disclose my father's nature to you, who're a stranger.Yes, such words have never before escaped, I assure vonOut of my mouth, which is little accustom'd to babble and chatter;But you have managed to worm all my secrets from out of my bosom.Well, my worthy father the graces of life holds in honour,Wishes for outward signs of love, as well as of rev'rence,And would doubtless be satisfied with an inferior servantWho understood this fancy, and hate a better, who did not."

모모Cheerfully she replied, with gentle movement increasingThrough the darkening path the speed at which she was walking:I in truth shall hope to satisfy both of your parents,For your mother's character my own nature resembles,And to external graces have I from my youth been accustom'd.Our old neighbours, the French, in their earlier days laid much stress onCourteous demeanour; 'twas common alike to nobles and burghers,And to peasants, and each enjoin'd it on all his acquaintance.in the same way, on the side of the Germans, the children were train'd upEvery morning, with plenty of kissing of hands and of curtsies,To salute their parents, and always to act with politeness.All that I have learnt, and all I have practised since childhood,All that comes from my heart,--I will practise it all with the old man.But on what terms shall I--I scarcely dare ask such a question,--Be with yourself, the only son, and hereafter my master?"

모모Thus she spoke, and at that moment they came to the peartree.Down from the skies the moon at her full was shining in glory;Night had arrived, and the last pale gleam of the sunset had vanish'd.So before them were lying, in masses all heap'd up together,Lights as clear as the day, and shadows of night and of darkness.And the friendly question was heard by Hermann with pleasure,Under the shade of the noble tree at the spot which he loved soWhich that day had witness'd his tears at the fate of the exile.And whilst they sat themselves down, to take a little repose there,Thus the loving youth spoke, whilst he seized the hand of the maiden"Let your heart give the answer, and always obey what it tells you!"But he ventured to say no more, however propitiousWas the moment; he feard that a No would be her sole answer,Ah! and he felt the ring on her finger, that sorrowful token.So by the side of each other they quietly sat and in silence,But the maiden began to speak, and said, "How delightfulIs the light of the moon! The clearness of day it resembles.Yonder I see in the town the houses and courtyards quite plainly,In the gable a window; methinks all the panes I can reckon."

모모"That which you see," replied the youth, who spoke with an effort,"That is our house down to which I now am about to conduct you,And that window yonder belongs to my room in the attic,Which will probably soon be yours, as we're making great changes.All these fields are ours, and ripe for the harvest to-morrow;Here in the shade we are wont to rest, enjoying our meal-time.But let us now descend across the vineyard and garden,For observe how the threatening storm is hitherward rolling,Lightening first, and then eclipsing the beautiful full moon."So the pair arose, and wauder'd down by the corn-field,

모모Through the powerful corn, in the nightly clearness rejoicing;And they reach'd the vineyard, and through its dark shadows proceeded.So he guided her down the numerous tiers of the flat stonesWhich, in an unhewn state, served as steps to the walk through the foliage.Slowly she descended, and placed her hands on his shoulders;And, with a quivering light, the moon through the foliage o'erlook'd them,Till by storm-clouds envelop'd, she left the couple in darkness.Then the strong youth supported the maiden, who on him was leaning;She, however, not knowing the path, or observing the rough steps,Slipp'd as she walk'd, her foot gave way, and she well nigh was falling.Hastily held out his arm the youth with nimbleness thoughtful,And held up his beloved one; she gently sank on his shoulders,Breast was press'd against breast, and cheek against cheek, and so stood heFix'd like a marble statue, restrained by a firm resolution;He embraced her no closer, thoughall her weight he supported;So he felt his noble burden, the warmth of her bosom,And her balmy breath, against his warm lips exhaling,Bearing with manly feelings the woman's heroical greatness.

모모But she conceal'd the pain which she felt, and jestingly spoke thus"It betokens misfortune,--so scrupulous people inform us,--For the foot to give way on entering a house, near the threshold.I should have wish'd, in truth, for a sign of some happier omen!Let us tarry a little, for fear your parents should blame youFor their limping servant, and you should be thought a bad landlord."-----IX.  URANIA.

모모CONCLUSION.

모모O YE Muses, who gladly favour a love that is heartfelt,Who on his way the excellent youth have hitherto guided,Who have press'd the maid to his bosom before their betrothal,Help still further to perfect the bonds of a couple so loving,Drive away the clouds which over their happiness hover!But begin by saying what now in the house has been passing.

모모For the third time the mother impatiently enter'd the chamberWhere the men were sitting, which she had anxiously quitted,Speaking of the approaching storm, and the loss of the moon's light,Then of her son's long absence, and all the perils that night brings.Strongly she censured their friends for having so soon left the youngster,For not even addressing the maiden, or seeking to woo her.

모모"Make not the worst of the mischief," the father peevishly answer'd;"For you see we are waiting ourselves, expecting the issue."

모모But the neighbour sat still, and calmly address'd them as follows:--"In uneasy moments like these, I always feel gratefulTo my late father, who when I was young all seeds of impatienceIn my mind uprooted, and left no fragment remaining,And I learnt how to wait, as well as the best of the wise men."Tell us what legerdemain he employ'd," the pastor made answer."I will gladly inform you, and each one may gain by the lesson,"Answer'd the neighbour. "When I was a boy, I was standing one SundayIn a state of impatience, eagerly waiting the carriageWhich was to carry us out to the fountain under the lime-trees;But it came not; I ran like a weasel now hither, now thither,Up and down the stairs, and from the door to the window;Both my hands were prickling, I scratch'd away at the tables,Stamping and trotting about, and scarcely refrain'd I from crying.All this the calm man composedly saw; but finally when ICarried my folly too far, by the arm he quietly took me,Led me up to the window, and used this significant language'See you up yonder the joiner's workshop, now closed for the Sunday?'Twill be re-open'd to-morrow, and plane and saw will be working.Thus will the busy hours be pass'd from morning till evening.But remember this: the rimming will soon be arriving,When the master, together with all his men, will be busyIn preparing and finishing quickly and deftly your coffin,And they will carefully bring over here that house made of boards, whichWill at length receive the patient as well as impatient,And which is destined to carry a roof that's unpleasantly heavy.All that he mention'd I forthwith saw taking place in my mind's eye,Saw the boards join'd together, and saw the black cover made ready,Patiently then I sat, and meekly awaited the carriage.And I always think of the coffin whenever I see menRunning about in a state of doubtful and wild expectation."

모모Smilingly answered the pastor:--"Death's stirring image is neitherUnto the wise a cause of alarm,--or an end to the pious.Back into life it urges the former, and teaches him action,And, for the weal of the latter, it strengthens his hope in affliction.Death is a giver of life unto both. Your father did wronglyWhen to the sensitive boy he pointed out death in its own form.Unto the youth should be shown the worth of a noble and ripen'dAge, and unto the old man, youth, that both may rejoice inThe eternal circle, and life may in life be made perfect!"

모모Here the door was open'd. The handsome couple appear'd there,And the friends were amazed, the loving parents astonish'dAt the form of the bride, the form of the bridegroom resembling.Yes! the door appear'd too small to admit the tall figuresWhich now cross'd the threshold, in company walking together.To his parents Hermann presented her, hastily saying:--"Here is a maiden just of the sort you are wishing to have here,Welcome her kindly, dear father! she fully deserves it, and you too,Mother dear, ask her questions as to her housekeeping knowledge,That you may see how well she deserves to form one of our party."Then he hastily took on one side the excellent pastor,Saying:--" Kind sir, I entreat you to help me out of this troubleQuickly, and loosen the knot, whose unravelling I am so dreading;For I have not ventured to woo as my bride the fair maiden,But she believes she's to be a maid in the house, and I fear meShe will in anger depart, as soon as we talk about marriage.But it must be decided at once! no longer in errorShall she remain, and I no longer this doubt can put up with.Hasten and once more exhibit that wisdom we all hold in honour."So the pastor forthwith turn'd round to the rest of the party,But the maiden's soul was, unhappily, troubled alreadyBy the talk of the father, who just had address'd her as follows,Speaking good humour'dly, and in accents pleasant and lively"Yes, I'm well satisfied, child! I joyfully see that my son hasJust as good taste as his father, who in his younger days show'd it,Always leading the fairest one out in the dance, and then lastlyTaking the fairest one home as his wife--'twas your dear little mother!For by the bride whom a man selects, we may easily gatherWhat kind of spirit his is, and whether he knows his own value.But you will surely need but a short time to form your decision,For I verily think he will find it full easy to follow."Hermann but partially heard the words; the whole of his membersInwardly quivered, and all the circle were suddenly silent.

모모But the excellent maiden, by words of such irony wounded,(As she esteem'd them to be) and deeply distress'd in her spirit,Stood, while a passing flush from her cheeks as far as her neck wasSpreading, but she restrain'd herself, and collected her thoughts soon;Then to the old man she said, not fully concealing her sorrow"Truly I was not prepared by your son for such a reception,When he described his father's nature,--that excellent burgher,And I know I am standing before you, a person of culture,Who behaves himself wisely to all, in a suitable manner.But it would seem that you feel not pity enough for the poor thingWho has just cross'd your threshold, prepared to enter your serviceElse you would not seek to point out, with ridicule bitter,How far removed my lot from your son's and that of yourself is.True, with a little bundle, and poor, I have enter'd your dwelling,Which it is the owner's delight to furnish with all things.But I know myself well, and feel the whole situation.Is it generous thus to greet me with language so jeering,Which was well nigh expelled me the house, when just on the threshold?"

모모Hermann uneasily moved about, and signed to the pastorTo interpose without delay, and clear up the error.Quickly the wise man advanced to the spot, and witness'd the maiden'sSilent vexation and tearful eyes and scarce-restrain'd sorrow.Then his spirit advised him to solve not at once the confusion,But, on the contrary, prove the excited mind of the maiden.So, in words framed to try her, the pastor address'd her as follows:--"Surely, my foreign maiden, you did not fully consider,When you made up your mind to serve a stranger so quickly,What it really is to enter the house of a master;For a shake of the hand decides your fate for a twelvemonth,And a single word Yes to much endurance will bind you.But the worst part of the service is not the wearisome habits,Nor the bitter toil of the work, which seems never-ending;For the active freeman works hard as well as the servant.But to suffer the whims of the master, who blames you unjustly,Or who calls for this and for that, not knowing his own mind,And the mistress's violence, always so easily kindled,With the children's rough and supercilious bad manners,--This is indeed hard to bear, whilst still fulfilling your dutiesPromptly and actively, never becoming morose or ill-natured;Yet for such work you appear little fit, for already the father'sJokes have offended you deeply; yet nothing more commonly happensThan to tease a maiden about her liking a youngster."Thus he spoke, and the maiden felt the weight of his language,And no more restrain'd herself; mightily all her emotionsShow'd themselves, her bosom heaved, and a deep sigh escaped her,And whilst shedding burning tears, she answer'd as follows:--"Ne'er does the clever man, who seeks to advise us in sorrow,Think how little his chilling words our hearts can deliverFrom the pangs which an unseen destiny fastens upon us.You are happy and merry. How then should a jest ever wound you?But the slightest touch gives torture to those who are suff'ring.Even dissimulation would nothing avail me at present.Let me at once disclose what later would deepen my sorrow,And consign me perchance to agony mute and consuming.Let me depart forthwith! No more in this house dare I linger;I must hence and away, and look once more for my poor friendsWhom I left in distress, when seeking to better my fortunes.This is my firm resolve; and now I may properly tell youThat which had else been buried for many a year in my bosom.Yes, the father's jest has wounded me deeply, I own it,Not that I'm proud and touchy, as ill becometh a servant,But because in truth in my heart a feeling has risenFor the youth, who to-day has fill'd the part of my Saviour.For when first in the road he left me, his image remain'd stillFirmly fix'd in my mind; and I thought of the fortunate maidenWhom, as his betroth'd one, he cherish'd perchance in his bosom.And when I found him again at the well, the sight of him charm'd meJust as if I had-seen an angel descending from heaven.And I follow'd him willingly, when as a servant he sought me,But by my heart in truth I was flatter'd (I need must confess it),As I hitherward came, that I might possibly win him,If I became in the house an indispensable pillar.But, alas, I now see the dangers I well nigh fell into,When I bethought me of living so near a silently-loved one.Now for the first time I feel how far removed a poor maidenIs from a richer youth, however clever she may be.I have told you all this, that you my heart may mistake not,Which an event that in thought I foreshadow has wounded already.For I must have expected, my secret wishes concealing,That, ere much time had elapsed, I should see him bringing his bride home.And how then could I have endured my hidden affliction!Happily I am warn'd in time, and out of my bosomHas my secret escaped, whilst curable still is the evil.But no more of the subject! I now must tarry no longerIn this house, where I now am standing in pain and confusion,All my foolish hopes and my feelings freely confessing.Not the night which, with sinking clouds, is spreading around us,Not the rolling thunder (I hear it already) shall stop me,Not the falling rain, which outside is descending in torrents,Not the blustering storm. All this I had to encounterIn that sorrowful flight, while the enemy follow'd behind Us.And once more I go on my way, as I long have been wont to,Seized by the whirlpool of time, and parted from all that I care for.So farewell! I'll tarry no longer. My fate is accomplish'd!"

모모Thus she spoke, and towards the door she hastily turn'd her,Holding under her arm the bundle she brought when arriving.But the mother seized by both of her arms the fair maiden,Clasping her round the body, and cried with surprise and amazement"Say, what signifies this? These fruitless tears, what denote they?No, I'll not leave you alone! You're surely my dear son's betroth'd one!"But the father stood still, and show'd a great deal of reluctance,Stared at the weeping girl, and peevishly spoke then as follows"This, then, is all the indulgence my friends are willing to give me,That at the close of the day the most unpleasant thing happens!For there is nothing I hate so much as the tears of a woman,And their passionate cries, set up with such heat and excitement,Which a little plain sense would show to be utterly needless.Truly, I find the sight of these whimsical doings a nuisance.Matters must shift for themselves; as for me, I think it is bed-time."So he quickly turn'd round, and hasten'd to go to the chamberWhere the marriage-bed stood, in which he slept for the most part.But his son held him back, and spoke in words of entreaty"Father, don't go in a hurry, and be not amniote with the maiden!I alone have to bear the blame of all this confusion,Which our friend has increased by his unexpected dissembling.Speak then, honour'd Sir! for to you the affair I confided;Heap not up pain and annoyance, but rather complete the whole matter;For I surely in future should not respect you so highly,If you play practical jokes, instead of displaying true wisdom."

모모Thereupon the worthy pastor smilingly answer'd"What kind of wisdom could have extracted the charming confessionOf this good maiden, and so have reveal'd all her character to us?Is not your care converted at once to pleasure and rapture?Speak out, then, for yourself! Why need explanations from othersHermann then stepped forward, and gently address'd her as follows"Do not repent of your tears, nor yet of your passing affliction;For they perfect my happiness; yours too, I fain would consider.I came not to the fountain, to hire so noble a maidenAs a servant, I came to seek to win you affections.But, alas! my timid gaze had not strength to discoverYour heart's leanings; it saw in your eye but a friendly expression,When you greeted it out of the tranquil fountain's bright mirror.Merely to bring you home, made half of my happiness certainBut you now make it complete! May every blessing be yours, then!"Then the maiden look'd on the youth with heartfelt emotion,And avoided not kiss or embrace, the summit of rapture,When they also are to the loving the long-wish'd-for pledgesOf approaching bliss in a life which now seems to them endless.Then the pastor told the others the whole of the story;But the maiden came and gracefully bent o'er the father,Kissing the while his hand, which he to draw back attempted.And she said:--" I am sure that you will forgive the surprised one,First for her tears of sorrow, and then for her tears of true rapture.O forgive the emotions by which they both have been prompted,And let me fully enjoy the bliss that has now been vouchsafed me!Let the first vexation, which my confusion gave rise to,Also be the last! The loving service which latelyWas by the servant promised, shall now by the daughter be render'd."

모모And the father, his tears concealing, straightway embraced her;Lovingly came the mother in turn, and heartily kiss'd her,Warmly shaking her hand; and silently wept they together.Then in a hasty manner, the good and sensible pastorSeized the hand of the father, his wedding-ring off from his fingerDrawing (not easily though; so plump was the member that held it)Then he took the mother's ring, and betroth'd the two children,Saying:--"Once more may it be these golden hoops' destinationFirmly to fasten a bond altogether resembling the old one!For this youth is deeply imbued with love for the maiden,And the maiden confesses that she for the youth has a liking.Therefore, I now betroth you, and wish you all blessings hereafter,With the parents' consent, and with our friend here as a witness."

모모And the neighbour bent forward, and added his own benediction;But when the clergyman placed the gold ring on the hand of the maiden,He with astonishment saw the one which already was on it,And which Hermann before at the fountain had anxiously noticed.Whereupon he spoke in words at once friendly and jesting"What! You are twice engaging yourself? I hope that the first oneMay not appear at the altar, unkindly forbidding the banns there!"

모모But she said in reply:--"O let me devote but one momentTo this mournful remembrance! For well did the good youth deserve it,Who, when departing, presented the ring, but never return'd home.All was by him foreseen, when freedom's love of a sudden,And a desire to play his part in the new-found Existence,Drove him to go to Paris, where prison and death were his portion.'Farewell,' said he, 'I go; for all things on earth are in motionAt this moment, and all things appear in a state of disunion.Fundamental laws in the steadiest countries are loosen'd,And possessions are parted from those who used to possess them,Friends are parted from friends, and love is parted from love too.I now leave you here, and whether I ever shall see youHere again,--who can tell? Perchance these words will our last be.Man is a stranger here upon earth, the proverb informs us;Every person has now become more a stranger than ever.Ours the soil is no longer; our treasures are fast flying from us;All the sacred old vessels of gold and silver are melted,All is moving, as though the old-fashion'd world would roll backwardsInto chaos and night, in order anew to be fashion'd.You of my heart have possession, and if we shall ever here-afterMeet again over the wreck of the world, it will be as new creatures,All remodell'd and free and independent of fortune;For what fetters can bind down those who survive such a period!But if we are destined not to escape from these dangers,If we are never again to embrace each other with rapturesO then fondly keep in your thoughts my hovering image,That you may be prepared with like courage for good and ill fortune!If a new home or a new alliance should chance to allure you,Then enjoy with thanks whatever your destiny offers,Purely loving the loving, and grateful to him who thus loves you.But remember always to tread with a circumspect footstep,For the fresh pangs of a second loss will behind you be lurking.Deem each day as sacred; but value not life any higherThan any other possession, for all possessions are fleeting.'Thus he spoke; and the noble youth and I parted for ever:Meanwhile I ev'rything lost, and a thousand times thought of his warning.Once more I think of his words, now that love is sweetly preparingHappiness for me anew, and the brightest of hopes is unfolding.Pardon me, dearest friend, for trembling e'en at the momentWhen I am clasping your arm! For thus, on first landing, the sailorFancies that even the solid ground is shaking beneath him."

모모Thus she spoke, and she placed the rings by the side of each other.But the bridegroom answer'd, with noble and manly emotion"All the firmer, amidst the universal disruption,Be, Dorothea, our union! We'll show ourselves bold and enduring,Firmly hold our own, and firmly retain our possessions.For the man who in wav'ring times is inclined to be wav'ringOnly increases the evil, and spreads it wider and wider;But the man of firm decision the universe fashions.'Tis not becoming the Germans to further this fearful commotion,And in addition to waver uncertainly hither and thither.'This is our own!' we ought to say, and so to maintain it!For the world will ever applaud those resolute nationsWho for God and the Law, their wives, and parents, and childrenStruggle, and fall when contending against the foeman together.You are mine; and now what is mine, is mine more than ever.Not with anxiety will I preserve it, or timidly use it,But with courage and strength. And if the enemy threatenNow or hereafter, I'll hold myself ready, and reach down my weapons.If I know that the house and my parents by you are protected,I shall expose my breast to the enemy, void of all terror;And if all others thought thus, then might against might should be measured,And in the early prospect of peace we should all be rejoicing."

모모1796?.-----WEST-EASTERN DIVAN.-----Who the song would understand,Needs must seek the song's own land.Who the minstrel understand,Needs must seek the minstrel's land.-----

모모THE Poems comprised in this collection are written in thePersian style, and are greatly admired by Oriental scholars, forthe truthfulness with which the Eastern spirit of poetry isreproduced by the Western minstrel. They were chiefly composedbetween the years 1814 and 1819, and first given to the world inthe latter year. Of the twelve books into which they are divided,that of Suleika will probably be considered the best, from themany graceful love-songs which it contains. The following isHanoi's account of the Divan, and may well serve as a substitutefor anything I could say respecting it:--

모모It contains opinions and sentiments on the East, expressed in aseries of rich cantos and stanzas full of sweetness and spirit,and all this as enchanting as a harem emitting the most deliciousand rare perfumes, and blooming with exquisitely-lovely nymphswith eyebrows painted black, eyes piercing as those of theantelope, arms white as alabaster, and of the most graceful andperfectly-formed shapes, while the heart of the reader beats andgrows faint, as did that of the happy Gaspard Debaran, the clown,who, when on the highest step of his ladder, was enabled to peepinto the Seraglio of Constantinople--that recess concealed fromthe inspection of man. Sometimes also the reader may imaginehimself indolently stretched on a carpet of Persian softness,luxuriously smoking the yellow tobacco of Turkistan through along tube of jessamine and amber, while a black slave fans himwith a fan of peacock's feathers, and a little boy presents himwith a cup of genuine Mocha. Goethe has put these enchanting andvoluptuous customs into poetry, and his verses are so perfect, soharmonious, so tasteful, so soft, that it seems really surprisingthat he should ever have been able to have brought the Germanlanguage to this state of suppleness. The charm of the book isinexplicable; it is a votive nosegay sent from the West to theEast, composed of the most precious and curious plants: redroses, hortensias like the breast of a spotless maiden, purpledigitalis like the long finger of a man, fantastically formedranunculi, and in the midst of all, silent and tastefullyconcealed, a tuft of German violets. This nosegay signifies thatthe West is tired of thin and icy-cold spirituality, and seekswarmth in the strong and healthy bosom of the East."

모모Translations are here given of upwards of sixty of the bestPoems embraced in the Divan, the number in the original exceedingtwo hundred.-----I.  MORGAGNI NAME.

모모Wherein to make our dwelling;

모모A sword, which, more than rocks and walls

모모Doth shield us, brightly glistening;A song that profits and enthrall,

모모For which the maids are list'ning!

모모1814.-----DISCORD.

모모WHEN by the brook his strain

모모Cupid is fluting,And on the neighboring plain

모모Mayors disputing,There turns the ear ere long,

모모Loving and tender,Yet to the noise a song

모모Soon must surrender.Loud then the flute-notes glad

모모Sound 'mid war's thunder;If I grow raving mad,

모모Is it a wonder?Flutes sing and trumpets bray,

모모Waxing yet stronger;If, then, my senses stray,

모모Wonder no longer.

모모A breast whence flows a loving song,A throat that finds no draught amiss,

모모An open heart that knows no wrong.

모모And what though all the world should sink!

모모So the winter now closed round themWith resistless fury. ScatteringOver all his breath so icy,He inflamed each wind that blitheTo assail them angrily.Over them he gave dominionTo his frost-unsharpened tempests;Down to Timur's council went he,And with threat'ning voice address'd him:--"Softly, slowly, wretched being!Live, the tyrant of injustice;But shall hearts be scorch'd much longerBy thy flames,--consume before them?If amongst the evil spiritsThou art one,--good! I'm another.Thou a greybeard art--so I am;Land and men we make to stiffen.Thou art Mars! And I Saturnus,--Both are evil-working planets,When united, horror-fraught.Thou dost kill the soul, thou freezesE'en the atmosphere; still colderIs my breath than thine was ever.Thy wild armies vex the faithfulWith a thousand varying torments;Well! God grant that I discoverEven worse, before I perish!And by God, I'll give thee none.Let God hear what now I tell thee!Yes, by God! from Death's cold clutchesNought, O greybeard, shall protect thee,Not the hearth's broad coalfire's ardour,Not December's brightest flame."

모모One small flask's contents to glean,

모모Whose sweet fragrance aye may live,Slender as thy finger e'en,

모모Must a world its treasures give;

모모Yes, a world where life is moving,

모모Which, with impulse full and strong,Could forbode the Bulbul's loving,

모모Sweet, and spirit-stirring song.

모모Since they thus have swell'd our joy,

모모Should such torments grieve us, then?Doth not Timur's rule destroy

모모Myriad souls of living men?

모모BOOK OF SULEIKA.

모모ONCE, methought, in the night hours cold,

모모That I saw the moon in my sleep;But as soon as I waken'd, behold

모모Unawares rose the sun from the deep.

모모THAT Suleika's love was so strong

모모For Joseph, need cause no surprise;

모모He was young, youth pleaseth the eyes,--

모모He was fair, they say, beyond measure

모모Fair was she, and so great was their pleasure.But that thou, who awaitedst me long,Youthful glances of fire dost throw me,Soon wilt bless me, thy love now dost show me,This shall my joyous numbers proclaim,Thee I for ever Suleika shall name.

모모1815.-----HATEM.

모모NOT occasion makes the thief;

모모She's the greatest of the whole;For Love's relics, to my grief,

모모From my aching heart she stole.

모모She hath given it to thee,--

모모All the joy my life had known,So that, in my poverty,

모모Life I seek from thee alone.

모모Yet compassion greets me straight

모모In the lustre of thine eye,And I bless my newborn fate,

모모As within thine arms I lie.

모모1815.-----SULEIKA.

모모THE sun appears! A glorious sight!

모모The crescent-moon clings round him now.What could this wondrous pair unite?

모모How to explain this riddle? How?

모모HATEM.

모모May this our joy's foreboder prove!

모모In it I view myself and thee;Thou calmest me thy sun, my love,--

모모Come, my sweet moon, cling thou round me!

모모1815.-----LOVE for love, and moments sweet,

모모Lips returning kiss for kiss,Word for word, and eyes that meet;

모모Breath for breath, and bliss for bliss.Thus at eve, and thus the morrow!

모모Yet thou feeblest, at my lay,Ever some half-hidden sorrow;Could I Joseph's graces borrow,

모모All thy beauty I'd repay!

모모1815.-----HATEM.

모모O, SAY, 'neath what celestial sign

모모The day doth lie,When ne'er again this heart of mine

모모Away will fly?And e'en though fled (what thought divine!)

모모Would near me lie?--On the soft couch, on whose sweet shrine

모모My heart near hers will lie!

모모1816.-----HATEM.

모모HOLD me, locks, securely caught

모모In the circle of her face!Dear brown serpents, I have nought

모모To repay this act of grace,

모모Save a heart whose love ne'er dies,

모모Throbbing with aye-youthful glow;For a raging ETA lies

모모'Neath its veil of mist and snow.

모모Yonder mountain's stately brow

모모Thou, like morning beams, dost shame;Once again feels Hatem now

모모Spring's soft breath and summer's flame.

모모One more bumper! Fill the glass;

모모This last cup I pledge to thee!--By mine ashes if she pass,

모모"He consumed," she'll say, "for me."

모모AND wherefore sends notThe horseman-captainHis heralds hither

모모Each day, unfailing?Yet hath he horses,He writes well.

모모He waiteth Tali,And Neski knows heTo write with beautyOn silken tablets.I'd deem him present,Had I his words.

모모The sick One will not,Will not recoverFrom her sweet sorrow;She, when she hearethThat her true loverGrows well, falls sick.

모모1819.*-----THE LOVING ONE AGAIN.

모모WRITES he in Neski,Faithfully speaks he;Writes he in Tali,Joy to give, seeks he:Writes he in either,Good!--for he loves!

모모1819.*-----THESE tufted branches fair

모모Observe, my loved one, well!And see the fruits they bear

모모In green and prickly shell!

모모They've hung roll'd up, till now,

모모Unconsciously and still;A loosely-waving bough

모모Doth rock them at its will.

모모Yet, ripening from within.

모모The kernel brown swells fast;It seeks the air to win,

모모It seeks the sun at last.

모모With joy it bursts its thrall,

모모The shell must needs give way.'Tis thus my numbers fall

모모Before thy feet, each day.

모모1815.-----SULEIKA.

모모WHAT is by this stir reveal'd?

모모Doth the East glad tidings bring?For my heart's deep wounds are heal'd

모모By his mild and cooling wing.

모모He the dust with sports doth meet,

모모And in gentle cloudlets chase;To the vineleaf's safe retreat

모모Drives the insects' happy race,

모모Cools these burning cheeks of mine,

모모Checks the sun's fierce glow Adam,Kisses, as he flies, the vine,

모모Flaunting over hill and plain.

모모And his whispers soft convey

모모Thousand greetings from my friend;Ere these hills own night's dark sway,

모모Kisses greet me, without end.

모모Thus canst thou still onward go,

모모Serving friend and mourner too!There, where lofty ramparts glow,

모모Soon the loved one shall I view.

모모Ah, what makes the heart's truth known,--

모모Love's sweet breath,--a newborn life,--Learn I from his mouth alone,

모모In his breath alone is rife!

모모1815.-----THE SUBLIME TYPE.

모모THE sun, whom Grecians Helms call,

모모His heavenly path with pride doth tread,And, to subdue the world's wide all,

모모Looks round, beneath him, high o'er head.

모모He sees the fairest goddess pine,

모모Heaven's child, the daughter of the clouds,--For her alone he seems to shine;

모모In trembling grief his form he shrouds,

모모Careless for all the realms of bliss,--

모모Her streaming tears more swiftly flow:For every pearl he gives a kiss,

모모And changeth into joy her woe.

모모She gazeth upward fixedly,

모모And deeply feels his glance of might,While, stamped with his own effigy,

모모Each pearl would range itself aright.

모모Thus wreath'd with bows, with hues thus grac'd,

모모With gladness beams her face so fair,While he, to meet her, maketh haste,

모모And yet, alas! can reach her ne'er.

모모So, by the harsh decree of Fate,

모모Thou modest from me, dearest one;And were I Helms e'en, the Great,

모모What would avail his chariot-throne?

모모1815.-----SULEIKA.

모모ZEPHYR, for thy humid wing,

모모Oh, how much I envy thee!Thou to him canst tidings bring

모모How our parting saddens me!

모모In my breast, a yearning still

모모As thy pinions wave, appears;Flow'rs and eyes, and wood, and hill

모모At thy breath are steeped in tears.

모모Yet thy mild wing gives relief,

모모Soothes the aching eyelid's pain;Ah, I else had died for grief,

모모Him ne'er hoped to see again.

모모To my love, then, quick repair,

모모Whisper softly to his heart;Yet, to give him pain, beware,

모모Nor my bosom's pangs impart.

모모Tell him, but in accents coy,

모모That his love must be my life;Both, with feelings fraught with joy,

모모In his presence will be rife.

모모1815.-----THE REUNION.

모모CAN it be! of stars the star,

모모Do I press thee to my heart?In the night of distance far,

모모What deep gulf, what bitter smart!Yes, 'tis thou, indeed, at last,

모모Of my joys the partner dear!Mindful, though, of sorrows past,

모모I the present needs must fear.

모모When the still-unfashion'd earth

모모Lay on God's eternal breast,He ordain'd its hour of birth,

모모With creative joy possess'd.Then a heavy sigh arose,

모모When He spake the sentence:--"Be!"And the All, with mighty throes,

모모Burst into reality.

모모And when thus was born the light,

모모Darkness near it fear'd to stay,And the elements with might

모모Fled on every side away;Each on some far-distant trace,

모모Each with visions wild employ,Numb, in boundless realm of space,

모모Harmony and feeling-void.

모모Dumb was all, all still and dead,

모모For the first time, God alone!Then He form'd the morning-red,

모모Which soon made its kindness known:It unravelled from the waste,

모모Bright and glowing harmony,And once more with love was grac'd

모모What contended formerly.

모모And with earnest, noble strife,

모모Each its own Peculiar sought;Back to full, unbounded life

모모Sight and feeling soon were brought.Wherefore, if 'tis done, explore

모모How? why give the manner, name?Allah need create no more,

모모We his world ourselves can frame.

모모So, with morning pinions bright,

모모To thy mouth was I impell'd;Stamped with thousand seals by night,

모모Star-clear is the bond fast held.Paragons on earth are we

모모Both of grief and joy sublime,And a second sentence:--"Be!"

모모Parts us not a second time.

모모1815.-----SULEIKA.

모모WITH what inward joy, sweet lay,

모모I thy meaning have descried!Lovingly thou seem'st to say

모모That I'm ever by his side;

모모That he ever thinks of me,

모모That he to the absent givesAll his love's sweet ecstasy,

모모While for him alone she lives.

모모Yes, the mirror which reveals

모모Thee, my loved one, is my breast;This the bosom, where thy seals

모모Endless kisses have impress'd.

모모Numbers sweet, unsullied truth,

모모Chain me down in sympathy!Love's embodied radiant youth,

모모In the garb of poesy!

모모1819.*-----IN thousand forms mayst thou attempt surprise,

모모Yet, all-beloved-one, straight know I thee;Thou mayst with magic veils thy face disguise,

모모And yet, all-present-one, straight know I thee.

모모Upon the cypress' purest, youthful bud,

모모All-beauteous-growing-one, straight know I thee;In the canal's unsullied, living flood,

모모All-captivating-one, well know I thee.

모모When spreads the water-column, rising proud,

모모All-sportive one, how gladly know I thee;When, e'en in forming, is transform'd the cloud,

모모All-figure-changing-one, there know I thee.

모모Veil in the meadow-carpet's flowery charms,

모모All-checkered-starry-fair-one, know I thee;And if a plant extend its thousand arms,

모모O, all-embracing-one, there know I thee.

모모When on the mount is kindled morn's sweet light,

모모Straightway, all-gladdening-one, salute I thee,The arch of heaven o'er head grows pure and bright,--

모모All-heart-expanding-one, then breathe I thee.

모모That which my inward, outward sense proclaims,

모모Thou all-instructing-one, I know through thee;And if I utter Allah's hundred names,

모모A name with each one echoes, meant for thee.

모모'Tis worth not a thought!Can the Koran a creation, then, be?

모모Of that, I know nought!Yet that the book of all books it must be,

모모I believe, as a Mussulman ought.That from Eternity wine, though, must be,

모모I ever have thought;That 'twas ordain'd, ere the Angels, to be,

모모As a truth may be taught.Drinkers, however these matters may be,

모모Gaze on God's face, fearing nought.

모모1815.-----YE'VE often, for our drunkenness,

모모Blamed us in ev'ry way,And, in abuse of drunkenness,

모모Enough can never say.Men, overcome by drunkenness,

모모Are wont to lie till day;And yet I find my drunkenness

모모All night-time make me stray;For, oh! 'tis Love's sweet drunkenness

모모That maketh me its prey,Which night and day, and day and night,

모모My heart must needs obey,--A heart that, in its drunkenness,

모모Pours forth full many a lay,So that no trifling drunkenness

모모Can dare assert its sway.Love, song, and wine's sweet drunkenness,

모모By night-time and by day,--How god-like is the drunkenness

모모That maketh me its prey!

모모Rose to Allah's throne on high;

모모To reward her melody,Giveth he a cage of gold.Such a cage are limbs of men,--

모모Yet when all she brings to mind,Straight the spirit sings again.

모모1819.*-----IN the Koran with strange delightA peacock's feather met my sight:Thou'rt welcome in this holy place,The highest prize on earth's wide face!As in the stars of heaven, in thee,God's greatness in the small we see;For he whose gaze whole worlds bath bless'dHis eye hath even here impress'd,And the light down in beauty dress'd,So that e'en monarchs cannot hopeIn splendour with the bird to cope.Meekly enjoy thy happy lot,And so deserve that holy spot!

모모1815.-----ALL kinds of men, both small and great,A fine-spun web delight to create,And in the middle they take their place,And wield their scissors with wondrous grace.But if a besom should sweep that way:"What a most shameful thing," they say,--"They've crush'd a mighty palace to-day."

모모1815.-----IT IS GOOD.

모모IN Paradise while moonbeams play'd,

모모Jehovah found, in slumber deep,Adam fast sunk; He gently laid

모모Eve near him,--she, too, fell asleep.There lay they now, on earth's fair shrine,God's two most beauteous thoughts divine.--When this He saw, He cried:--'Tis Good!!!And scarce could move from where He stood.

모모No wonder, that our joy's completeWhile eye and eye responsive meet,When this blest thought of rapture moves us--That we're with Him who truly loves us,And if He cries:--Good, let it be!'Tis so for both, it seems to me.Thou'rt clasp'd within these arms of mine,Dearest of all God's thoughts divine!

모모When we oft have seen the monarch ride,Gold upon him, gold on ev'ry side;Jewels on him, on his courtiers all,Thickly strewed as hailstones when they fall,

모모Have ye e'er known envy at the sight?And not felt your gaze become more bright,When the sun was, on the wings of morning,Darnawend's unnumber'd peaks adorning,

모모As he, bow-like, rose? How each eye dweltOn the glorious scene! I felt, I felt,Thousand times, as life's days fleeted by,Borne with him, the coming one, on high.

모모God upon His throne then to proclaim,Him, the life-fount's mighty Lord, to name,Worthily to prize that glorious sight,And to wander on beneath His light.

모모When the fiery orb was all defined,There I stood, as though in darkness, blind,Beat my breast, my quicken'd members threwOn the earth, brow-foremost, at the view.

모모Let this holy, great bequest rewardBrotherly good-will and kind regard:SOLEMN DUTY'S DAILY observation.--More than this, it needs no revelation.

모모If its gentle hands a new-born oneMove, then straightway turn it tow'rd the sun,--Soul and body dip in bath of fire!Then each morning's favour 'twill acquire.

모모To the living one, commit the dead,O'er the beast let earth and dust be spread,And, so far as may extend your might,What ye deem impure, conceal from sight.

모모Till your plains to graceful purity,That the sun with joy your labours see;When ye plant, your trees in rows contrive,For he makes the Regular to thrive.

모모E'en the floods that through the channel rushMust not fail in fulness or in gush;And as Senderud, from mountain high,Rises pure, in pureness must it die.

모모Not to weaken water's gentle fall,Carefully cleanse out the channels all;Salamander, snake, and rush, and reed,--All destroy,--each monster and each weed.

모모If thus pure ye earth and water keep,Through the air the sun will gladly peep,Where he, worthily enshrined in space,Worketh life, to life gives holy grace.

모모Ye, by toil on toil so sorely tried,Comfort take, the All is purified;And now man, as priest, may boldly dareFrom the stone God's image to prepare.

모모When the flame burns joyously and bright,Limbs are supple, radiant is the night;On the hearth when fire with ardour glows,Ripe the sap of plants and creatures grows.

모모Dragging wood, with rapture be it done,'Tis the seed of many an earthly sun;Plucking Pambeh, gladly may ye say:--This, as wick, the Holy will convey.

모모If ye meekly, in each burning lamp,See the nobler light's resplendent stamp,Ne'er will Fate prevent you, void of feeling,At God's throne at morningtide from kneeling.

모모This is Being's mighty signet, then,God's pure glass to angels and to men;Each word lisped the Highest's praise to sound,Ring in ring, united there is found.

모모From the shore of Senderud ascendeth,Up to Darnawend its pinions bendeth,As He dawns, with joy to greet His light,You with endless blessings to requite.

모모BOOK OF PARADISE.

모모THE PRIVILEGED MEN.

모모AFTER THE BATTLE OF BADE, BENEATH THE CANOPY OF HEAVEN.

모모[This battle was fought in the second year of the Hegira (A.A.623), between the followers of Mahomet, who numbered threehundred and thirteen, possessing two horses and seventy camels,and the 'idolaters,' or Meccans, whose forces amounted to ninehundred and fifty, including two hundred cavalry. The victoryremained with Mahomet, who lost fourteen men, while seventy ofthe enemy were slain. A great accession of strength ensued inconsequence to the Prophet, who pretended that miracles werewrought in his behalf in the battle, God having sent angels tofight on his side, and having also made his army to appear largerto the enemy than it really was.--See the Koran, chapter viii.,and ABULFEDA'S Life of Mahomet.]

모모MAHOMET (Speaks).

모모LET the foeman sorrow o'er his dead,

모모Ne'er will they return again to light;O'er our brethren let no tear be shed,

모모For they dwell above yon spheres so bright.

모모All the seven planets open throw

모모All their metal doors with mighty shock,And the forms of those we loved below

모모At the gates of Eden boldly knock.

모모There they find, with bliss ne'er dream'd before,

모모Glories that my flight first show'd to eye,When the wondrous steed my person bore

모모In one second through the realms on high.

모모Wisdom's trees, in cypress-order growing,

모모High uphold the golden apples sweet;Trees of life, their spreading shadows throwing,

모모Shade each blossoming plant, each flow'ry seat.

모모Now a balmy zephyr from the East

모모Brings the heavenly maidens to thy view;With the eye thou now dost taste the feast,

모모Soon the sight pervades thee through and through.

모모There they stand, to ask thee thy career:

모모Mighty plans? or dangerous bloody rout?Thou'rt a hero, know they,--for Thourt here,

모모What a hero?--This they'll fathom out.

모모By thy wounds soon clearly this is shown,

모모Wounds that write thy fame's undying story;Wounds the true believer mark alone,

모모When have perish'd joy and earthly glory.

모모To chiosks and arbors thou art brought,

모모Fill'd with checkered marble columns bright;To the noble grape-juice, solace-fraught,

모모They the guest with kindly sips invite.

모모Youth! Thou'rt welcome more than e'er was youth

모모All alike are radiant and serene;When thou tak'st one to thine heart with truth,

모모Of thy band she'll be the friend and queen.

모모So prepare thee for this place of rest,

모모Never can it now be changed again;Maids like these will ever make thee blest,

모모Wines like these will never harm thy brain.

모모1819.-----THE FAVOURED BEASTS.

모모Or beasts there have been chosen four

모모To come to Paradise,And there with saints for evermore

모모They dwell in happy wise.

모모Amongst them all the Ass stands first;

모모He comes with joyous stride,For to the Prophet-City erst

모모Did Jesus on him ride.

모모Half timid next a Wolf doth creep,

모모To whom Mahomet spake"Spoil not the poor man of his sheep,

모모The rich man's thou mayst take."

모모And then the brave and faithful Hound,

모모Who by his master kept,And slept with him the slumbers sound

모모The seven sleepers slept.

모모Abuherrira's Cat, too, here,

모모Purrs round his master blest,For holy must the beast appear

모모The Prophet hath caress'd.

모모1815.-----THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.

모모Six among the courtiers favour'dFly before the Caesar's fury,Who would as a god be worshipp'd,Though in truth no god appearing,For a fly prevents him everFrom enjoying food at table.Though with fans his servants scare it,They the fly can never banish.It torments him, stings, and troubles,And the festal board perplexes,Then returning like the heraldOf the olden crafty Fly-God."What!"--the striplings say together--"Shall a fly a god embarrass?

모모Shall a god drink, eat at table,Like us mortals? No, the Only,Who the sun and moon created,And the glowing stars arch'd o'er us,He is God,--we'll fly!"--The gentle,Lightly shod, and dainty striplingsDid a shepherd meet, and hide them,With himself, within a cavern.

모모And the sheep-dog will not leave them,--Scared away, his foot all-mangled,To his master still he presses,And he joins the hidden party,Joins the favorites of slumber.

모모And the prince, whom they had fled from,Fondly-furious, thinks of vengeance,And, discarding sword and fire,Has them walled-up in the cavern,Walled-up fast with bricks and mortar.

모모But the others slumber ever,And the Angel, their protector,Gives before God's throne this notice"To the right and left alternateHave I ever cared to turn them,That their fair and youthful membersBe not by the mould-damp injured;Clefts within the rocks I open'd,That the sun may, rising, setting,Keep their cheeks in youthful freshness."So they lie there, bless'd by Heaven.And, with forepaws sound and scatheless,Sleeps the dog in gentle slumber.

모모Years come round, and years fly onward,And the youths at length awaken,And the wall, which now had moldered,From its very age has fallen.And Jamblika says,--whose beautyFar exceedeth all the others,--When the fearful shepherd lingers:--"I will run, and food procure you,Life and piece of gold I'll wager!"--Ephebus had many a year nowOwn'd the teaching of the ProphetJesus (Peace be with the Good One!)

모모And he ran, and at the gatewayWere the warders and the others.Yet he to the nearest baker's,Seeking bread, went swiftly onwards.--"Rogue!" thus cried the baker--"hast thou,Youth, a treasure, then, discover'd?Give me,--for the gold betrays thee,--Give me half, to keep thy secret!"--

모모And they quarrel.--To the monarchComes the matter; and the monarchFain would halve it, like the baker.

모모Now the miracle is provenSlowly by a hundred tokens.He can e'en his right establishTo the palace he erected,For a pillar, when pierced open.

모모Leads to wealth he said 'twould lead to.Soon are gather'd there whole races,Their relationship to show him.And as great-grandfather, noblyStands Jamblika's youthful figure.

모모As of ancestors, he hears them,Speaking of his son and grandsons.His great-grandsons stand around him,Like a race of valiant mortals,Him to honour,--him, the youngest.And one token on anotherRises up, the proof completing;The identity is provenOf himself, and of his comrades.

모모Now returns he to the cavern,With him go both king and people.--Neither to the king nor peopleE'er returns that chosen mortal;For the Seven, who for ages--Eight was, with the dog, their number--Had from all the world been sunder'd,Gabriel's mysterious power,To the will of God obedient,Hath to Paradise conducted,--And the cave was closed for ever.

모모-----FROM FAUST.

모모I.DEDICATION.

모모YE shadowy forms, again ye're drawing near,

모모So wont of yore to meet my troubled gaze!Were it in vain to seek to keep you here?

모모Loves still my heart that dream of olden days?Oh, come then! and in pristine force appear,

모모Parting the vapor mist that round me plays!My bosom finds its youthful strength again,Feeling the magic breeze that marks your train.

모모Ye bring the forms of happy days of yore,

모모And many a shadow loved attends you too;Like some old lay, whose dream was well nigh o'er,

모모First-love appears again, and friendship true;Upon life's labyrinthine path once more

모모Is heard the sigh, and grief revives anew;The friends are told, who, in their hour of pride,Deceived by fortune, vanish'd from my side.

모모No longer do they hear my plaintive song,

모모The souls to whom I sang in life's young day;Scatter'd for ever now the friendly throng,

모모And mute, alas! each sweet responsive lay.My strains but to the careless crowd belong,

모모Their smiles but sorrow to my heart convey;And all who heard my numbers erst with gladness,If living yet, roam o'er the earth in sadness.

모모Long buried yearnings in my breast arise,

모모Yon calm and solemn spirit-realm to gain;Like the AEONIAN harp's sweet melodies,

모모My murmuring song breathes forth its changeful strain.A trembling seizes me, tears fill mine eyes,

모모And softer grows my rugged heart amain.All I possess far distant seems to be,The vanish'd only seems reality.

모모II.PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN.

모모THE ARCHANGELS' SONG.

모모RAPHAEL.

모모THE sun still chaunts, as in old time,

모모With brother-spheres in choral song,And with his thunder-march sublime

모모Moves his predestined course along.Strength find the angels in his sight,

모모Though he by none may fathomed be;Still glorious is each work of might

모모As when first form'd in majesty.

모모GABRIEL.

모모And swift and swift, in wondrous guise,

모모Revolves the earth in splendour bright,The radiant hues of Paradise

모모Alternating with deepest night.From out the gulf against the rock,

모모In spreading billows foams the ocean,--And cliff and sea with mighty shock,

모모The spheres whirl round in endless motion.

모모MICHAEL.

모모And storms in emulation growl

모모From land to sea, from sea to land,And fashion, as they wildly howl,

모모A circling, wonder-working band.Destructive flames in mad career

모모Precede Thy thunders on their way;Yet, Lord, Thy messengers revere

모모The soft mutations of Thy day.

모모THE THREE.

모모Strength find the angels in Thy sight,

모모Though none may hope to fathom Thee;Still glorious are Thy works of might,

모모As when first form'd in majesty.

모모III.CHORUS OF ANGELS.

모모CHRIST is arisen!

모모Mortal, all hail!Thou, of Earth's prison

모모Dreary and frail,Bursting the veil,

모모Proudly hast risen!

모모CHORUS OF WOMEN.

모모Rich spices and myrrh,

모모To embalm Him we brought;His corpse to inter

모모His true followers sought.In pure cerements shrin'd,

모모'Twas placed in the bierBut, alas! we now find

모모That Christ is not here.

모모CHORUS OF ANGELS.

모모Christ is arisen!

모모Speechless His love.Who to Earth's prison

모모Came from above,Trials to prove.

모모Now is He risen!

모모CHORUS OF YOUTHS.

모모Death's gloomy portal

모모Now hath He rended,--Living, immortal,

모모Heavenward ascended;Freed from His anguish,

모모Sees He God's throne;We still must languish,

모모Earthbound, alone.Now that He's reft us,

모모Heart-sad we pine;Why hast Thou left us,

모모Master divine?

모모CHORUS OF ANGELS.

모모Christ is arisen,

모모Death hath He slain;

모모Burst ye your prison,

모모Rend ye each chain!

모모Songs of praise lead ye,--

모모Love to show, heed ye,--

모모Hungry ones feed ye,--

모모Preaching, on speed ye,--

모모Coming joys plead ye,--Then is the Master near,Then is He here!

모모IV.CHORUS OF SPIRITS.

모모VANISH, dark clouds on high,

모모Offspring of night!Let a more radiant beamThrough the blue ether gleam,

모모Charming the sight!Would the dark clouds on high

모모Melt into air!Stars glimmer tenderly,

모모Planets more fair

모모Shed their soft light.Spirits of heav'nly birth,Fairer than sons of earth,Quivering emotions true

모모Hover above;Yearning affections, too,

모모In their train move.See how the spirit-band,By the soft breezes fann'd,Covers the smiling land,--Covers the leafy grove,Where happy lovers rove,Deep in a dream of love,True love that never dies!Bowers on bowers rise,

모모Soft tendrils twine;While from the press escapes,Born of the juicy grapes,

모모Foaming, the wine;And as the current flowsO'er the bright stones it goes,--Leaving the hilly lands

모모Far, far behind,--Into a sea expands,

모모Loving to windRound the green mountain's base;And the glad-winged race,

모모Rapture sip in,As they the sunny light,And the fair islands bright,

모모Hasten to win,That on the billows playWith sweet deceptive ray,Where in glad choral songShout the exulting throng;Where on the verdant plain

모모Dancers we see,Spreading themselves amain

모모Over the lea.Some boldly climbing are

모모O'er the steep brake,Others are floating far

모모O'er the smooth lake.All for a purpose move,

모모All with life teem,While the sweet stars above

모모Blissfully gleam.

모모V.MARGARET AT HER SPINNING-WHEEL.

모모MY heart is sad,

모모My peace is o'er;I find it never

모모And nevermore.

모모When gone is he,The grave I see;The world's wide allIs turned to gall.

모모Alas, my head

모모Is well-nigh crazed;My feeble mind

모모Is sore amazed.

모모My heart is sad,

모모My peace is o'er;I find it never

모모And nevermore.

모모For him from the window

모모Alone I spy;For him alone

모모From home go I.

모모His lofty step,

모모His noble form,His mouth's sweet smile,

모모His glances warm,

모모His voice so fraught

모모With magic bliss,His hand's soft pressure,

모모And, ah, his kiss!

모모My heart is sad,

모모My peace is o'er;I find it never

모모And nevermore.

모모My bosom yearns

모모For his form so fair;Ah, could I clasp him

모모And hold him there!

모모My kisses sweet

모모Should stop his breath,And 'neath his kisses

모모I'd sink in death!

모모Who dares to say that he believes in God?Go, bid the priest a truthful answer give,

모모Go, ask the wisest who on earth e'er trod,--Their answer will appear to beGiven alone in mockery.

모모MARGARET.

모모Then thou dost not believe? This sayest thou?

모모FAUST.

모모Sweet love, mistake not what I utter now!Who knows His name?Who dares proclaim:--Him I believe?Who so can feelHis heart to steelTo sari believe Him not?The All-Embracer,The All-Sustained,Holds and sustains He notThee, me, Himself?

모모Hang not the heavens their arch overhead?Lies not the earth beneath us, firm?Gleam not with kindly glancesEternal stars on high?Looks not mine eye deep into thine?And do not all thingsCrowd on thy head and heart,And round thee twine, in mystery eterne,Invisible, yet visible?Fill, then, thy heart, however vast, with this,And when the feeling perfecteth thy bliss,O, call it what thou wilt,Call it joy! heart! love! God!No name for it I know!'Tis feeling all--nought else;Name is but sound and smoke,Obscuring heaven's bright glow.

모모VII.MARGARET, Placing fresh flowers in the flower-pots.

모모O THOU well-tried in grief,

모모Grant to thy child relief,And view with mercy this unhappy one!

모모The sword within thy heart,

모모Speechless with bitter smart,Thou Lookest up towards thy dying son.

모모Thou look'st to God on high,

모모And breathest many a sighO'er his and thy distress, thou holy One!

모모Who e'er can know

모모The depth of woe

모모Piercing my very bone?The sorrows that my bosom fill,Its trembling, its aye-yearning will,

모모Are known to thee, to thee alone!

모모Wherever I may go,

모모With woe, with woe, with woe,My bosom sad is aching!

모모I scarce alone can creep,

모모I weep, I weep, I weep,My very heart is breaking.

모모The flowers at my window

모모My falling tears bedewed,When I, at dawn of morning,

모모For thee these flow'rets strewed.

모모When early to my chamber

모모The cheerful sunbeams stole,I sat upon my pallet,

모모In agony of soul.

모모Help! rescue me from death and misery!

모모Grant to thy child relief,And view with mercy my deep agony!

모모WHEN the moist and balmy gale

모모Round the verdant meadow sighs,Odors sweet in misty veil

모모At the twilight-hour arise.Murmurings soft of calm repose

모모Wouldst thou wish for wish obtain,

모모ACT I.

모모CLARA winds a skein, and sings with Brackenburg.

모모THE drum gives the signal!

모모Loud rings the shrill fife!My love leads his troops on

모모Full arm'd for the strife,While his hand grasps his lanceAs they proudly advance.

모모My bosom pants wildly!My blood hotly flows!Oh had I a doublet,A helmet, and hose!

모모Through the gate with bold footstep

모모I after him hied,--Each province, each country

모모Explored by his side.The coward foe trembledThen rattled our shot:What bliss e'er resembled

모모A soldier's glad lot!

모모ACT III.

모모CLARA sings.

모모Gladness

모모And sadnessAnd pensiveness blending

모모Yearning

모모And burningIn torment ne'er ending;

모모Sad unto death,Proudly soaring above;

모모Happy aloneIs the soul that doth love!

모모FROM "WILHELM MEISTER'S APPRENTICESHIP."

모모BOOK II., CHAP. XIII.

모모WHO never eat with tears his bread,

모모Who never through night's heavy hoursSat weeping on his lonely bed,--

모모He knows you not, ye heavenly powers!

모모Through you the paths of life we gain,

모모Ye let poor mortals go astray,And then abandon them to pain,--

모모E'en here the penalty we pay,-----WHO gives himself to solitude,

모모Soon lonely will remain;Each lives, each loves in joyous mood,

모모And leaves him to his pain.

모모Yes! leave me to my grief!Were solitude's relief

모모E'er granted me,

모모Alone I should not be.

모모A lover steals, on footstep light,

모모To learn if his love's alone;Thus o'er me steals, by day and night,

모모Anguish before unknown,Thus o'er me steals deep grief.Ah, when I find relief

모모Within the tomb so lonely,

모모Will rest be met with only!-----BOOK IV., CHAP. XI.

모모My grief no mortals know,

모모Except the yearning!Alone, a prey to woe,

모모All pleasure spurning,Up tow'rds the sky I throw

모모A gaze discerning.

모모He who my love can know

모모Seems ne'er returning;With strange and fiery glow

모모My heart is burning.My grief no mortals know,

모모Except the yearning!-----BOOK V., CHAP. X.

모모SING no more in mournful tones

모모Of the loneliness of night;For 'tis made, ye beauteous ones,

모모For all social pleasures bright.

모모As of old to man a wife

모모As his better half was given,So the night is half our life,

모모And the fairest under heaven.

모모How can ye enjoy the day,

모모Which obstructs our rapture's tide?Let it waste itself away;

모모Worthless 'tis for aught beside.

모모But when in the darkling hours

모모From the lamp soft rays are glowing,And from mouth to mouth sweet showers,

모모Now of jest, now love, are flowing,--

모모When the nimble, wanton boy,

모모Who so wildly spends his days,Oft amid light sports with joy

모모O'er some trifling gift delays,?

모모When the nightingale is singing

모모Strains the lover holds so dear,Though like sighs and wailings ringing

모모In the mournful captive's ear,--

모모With what heart-emotion blest

모모Do ye hearken to the bell,Wont of safety and of rest

모모With twelve solemn strokes to tell!

모모Therefore in each heavy hour,

모모Let this precept fill your heart:O'er each day will sorrow loud,

모모Rapture ev'ry night impart.-----EPILOGUE TO SCHILLER'S "SONG OF THE BELL."

모모[This fine piece, written originally in 1805, on Schiller'sdeath, was altered and recast by Goethe in 1815, on the occasionof the performance on the stage of the Song of the Bell. Hencethe allusion in the last verse.]

모모To this city joy reveal it!

모모Peace as its first signal peal it!

모모(Song of the Bell--concluding lines.)

모모AND so it proved! The nation felt, ere long,

모모That peaceful signal, and, with blessings fraught,A new-born joy appear'd; in gladsome song

모모To hail the youthful princely pair we sought;While in a living, ever-swelling throng

모모Mingled the crowds from ev'ry region brought,And on the stage, in festal pomp array'dThe HOMAGE OF THE ARTS * we saw displayed.

모모(* The title of a lyric piece composed by Schiller in honour ofthe marriage of the hereditary Prince of Weimar to the PrincessMaria of Russia, and performed in 1804.)

모모When, lo! a fearful midnight sound I hear,

모모That with a dull and mournful echo rings.And can it be that of our friend so dear

모모It tells, to whom each wish so fondly clings?Shall death overcome a life that all revere?

모모How such a loss to all confusion brings!How such a parting we must ever rue!The world is weeping,--shall not we weep too?

모모He was our own! How social, yet how great

모모Seem'd in the light of day his noble mind!How was his nature, pleasing yet sedate,

모모Now for glad converse joyously incline,Then swiftly changing, spirit-fraught, elate,

모모Life's plan with deep-felt meaning it design'd,Fruitful alike in counsel and in deed!This have we proved, this tasted, in our need.

모모He was our own! O may that thought so blest

모모Overcome the voice of wailing and of woeHe might have sought the Lasting, safe at rest

모모In harbour, when the tempest ceased to blow.Meanwhile his mighty spirit onward press'd

모모Where goodness, beauty, truth, for ever grow;And in his rear, in shadowy outline, layThe vulgar, which we all, alas, obey!

모모Now doth he deck the garden-turret fair

모모Where the stars' language first illuded his soul,As secretly yet clearly through the air

모모On the eterne, the living sense it stole;And to his own, and our great profit, there

모모Exchangeth he the seasons as they roll;Thus nobly doth he vanquish, with renown,The twilight and the night that weigh us down.

모모Brighter now glow'd his cheek, and still more bright.

모모With that unchanging, ever-youthful glow,--That courage which overcomes, in hard-fought fight,

모모Sooner or later, ev'ry earthly foe--That faith which, soaring to the realms of light,

모모Now boldly Presseth on, now bendeth low,So that the good may work, wax, thrive amain,So that the day the noble may attain.

모모Yet, though so skill'd, of such transcendent worth,

모모This boarded scaffold doth he not despise;The fate that on its axis turns the earth

모모From day to night, here shows he to our eyes,Raising, through many a work of glorious birth,

모모Art and the artist's fame up tow'rd the skies.He fills with blossoms of the noblest strife,With life itself, this effigy of life.

모모His giant-step, as ye full surely knew,

모모Measured the circle of the will and deed,Each country's changing thoughts and morals too,

모모The darksome book with clearness could he read;Yet how he, breathless 'midst his friends so true,

모모Despaired in sorrow, scarce from pain was freed,--All this have we, in sadly happy years,For he was ours, bewailed with feeling tears.

모모When from the agonizing weight of grief

모모He raised his eyes upon the world again,We show'd him how his thoughts might find relief

모모From the uncertain present's heavy chain,Gave his fresh-kindled mind a respite brief,

모모With kindly skill beguiling ev'ry pain,And e'en at eve, when setting was his sun,From his wan cheeks a gentle smile we won.

모모Full early had he read the stern decree,

모모Sorrow and death to him, alas, were known;Ofttimes recovering, now departed he,--

모모Dread tidings, that our hearts had fear'd to own!Yet his transfigured being now can see

모모Itself, e'en here on earth, transfigured grown.What his own age reproved, and deem'd a crime,Hath been ennobled now by death and time.

모모And many a soul that with him strove in fight,

모모And his great merit grudged to recognise,Now feels the impress of his wondrous might,

모모And in his magic fetters gladly lies;E'en to the highest bath he winged his flight,

모모In close communion link'd with all we prize.Extol him then! What mortals while they liveBut half receive, posterity shall give.

모모Thus is he left us, who so long ago,--

모모Ten years, alas, already!--turn'd from earth;We all, to our great joy, his precepts know,

모모Oh may the world confess their priceless worth!In swelling tide tow'rd every region flow

모모The thoughts that were his own peculiar birth;He gleams like some departing meteor bright,Combining, with his own, eternal light.-----

모모L'ENVOl.

모모-----Now, gentle reader, is our journey ended,

모모Mute is our minstrel, silent is our song;Sweet the bard's voice whose strains our course attended,

모모Pleasant the paths he guided us along.Now must we part,--Oh word all full of sadness,Changing to pensive retrospect our gladness!

모모Reader, farewell! we part perchance for ever,

모모Scarce may I hope to meet with thee again;But e'en though fate our fellowship may sever,

모모Reader, will aught to mark that tie remain?Yes! there is left one sad sweet bond of union,--Sorrow at parting links us in communion.

모모But of the twain, the greater is my sorrow,--

모모Reader, and why?--Bethink thee of the sun,How, when he sets, he waiteth for the morrow,

모모Proudly once more his giant-race to run,--Yet, e'en when set, a glow behind him leaving,Gladdening the spirit, which had else been grieving.

모모Thus mayst thou feel, for thou to GOETHE only

모모Baldest farewell, nor camest aught for me.Twofold my parting, leaving me all lonely,--

모모I now must part from GOETHE and from thee,Parting at once from comrade and from leader,--Farewell, great minstrel! farewell, gentle reader!

모모Hush'd is the harp, its music sunk in slumbers,Memory alone can waken now its numbers.

모모End
